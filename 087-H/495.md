# Invalid expiration blocks users from refunding, and also causes abuses of bounty contracts

## Summary

In the document, the expiration of the deposit should be a number of days, but the `_expiration` could be a number of seconds. The invalid `_expiration` could block users from refunding, and also causes abuses of bounty contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail

In [document Deposit Period Days](https://docs.openq.dev/fixed-price-contracts/fund-contract#deposit-period-days):
> Deposit Period Days is how long your funds will be locked in the smart contract.
> After this number of days, you will be able to refund your deposit if it hasn't already been claimed by successful work completion.

It defines a number of days, but the `_expiration` parameter is a number of seconds. Any user could deposit their funds and refund them only after a second.

An example of an exploit scenario is that an attacker could maliciously increase the length of `deposits` array to become a large length (by repeatedly funding and refunding due to the cheap gas fee on Polygon), causing anyone being unable to refund.
Because `refundDeposit()` calls `bounty.getLockedFunds(depToken)` to calculate `availableFunds`, but a large length of `deposits` will trigger the gas limit DoS of the for loop, the transaction will be reverted in the for loop of `getLockedFunds()`.

## Impact

There are some scenario examples in this issue.
* Users could change their mind after a second to refund, which is different from the document that users should wait a number of days.
* An attacker could maliciously increase the length of `deposits` array to become a large length (by repeatedly funding and refunding due to the cheap gas fee on Polygon), causing anyone being unable to refund due to the gas limit DoS of `bounty.getLockedFunds(depToken)` in `refundDeposit()`.
* Users could make a fake donation, and (frontrunning) refund their money back before someone wants to claim the fund.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use `_expiration * 86400` in `fundBountyToken()`:

```solidity
        (bytes32 depositId, uint256 volumeReceived) = bounty.receiveFunds{
            value: msg.value
        }(msg.sender, _tokenAddress, _volume, _expiration * 86400);
```

The same fix in `extendDeposit()` and `fundBountyNFT()`.
