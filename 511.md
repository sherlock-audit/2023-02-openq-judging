# ```ClaimManagerV1.sol``` does not call ```claimNFT``` for Ongoing bounties

## Summary

```ClaimManagerV1.sol``` does not call the Ongoing bounty's ```claimNft``` function which may lead to partially unfilled claims.

## Vulnerability Detail

When claimng from an Ongoing bounty contract, the ```claimBounty``` function in ```ClaimManagerV1.sol``` calls the ```_claimOngoingBounty``` function. The function will call the ```OngoingBountyV1.sol```'s ```claimOngoingPayout``` function to claim tokens sent to the bounty contract but does not call ```claimNFT``` to claim NFTs sent to the contract. All NFTs sent to the county cannot be claimed and must be refunded.

## Impact

If a funder has funded the bounty with tokens and NFTs and the Oracle claims the bounty on the winner's behalf, the winner will unexpectedly not receive their NFTs.
