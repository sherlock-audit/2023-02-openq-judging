# Function `closeCompetition()` in `TieredBountyPercentage` contract can be bricked, stopping claims

## Summary
The function `closeCompetition()` in contract `TieredBountyPercentage` is called when a claim is made. This function however makes unsafe external calls which, if it reverts, can stop the funds from being claimed.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function `closecompetition` is defined as shown

This function is crucial for the claiming process, since if this function reverts, the claims do not go through.

This function calls `getTokenBalance`, which ends up calling the contract at _tokenAddress to check the balance

A user can deposit the contract with a malicious token contract, and make the `balanceOf()` call revert when the bounty contract tries to call it. This will stop the claims process and break the bounty.
## Impact
Broken bounty contract where winners are unable to claim their prize tokens/Nfts

## Recommendation
Make external calls such as `balanceOf()` inside a try-catch block, to prevent unintended reverts.
