# BountyCore.receiveFunds() can revert with native ETH if _volume is 0.

## Summary
When a user calls fundBountyToken with native ETH they are required to input a value for _volume even though it is only used in receiving ERC20 tokens as msg.value is used for ETH.

## Vulnerability Detail
If a user is trying to fundBountyToken(), the volumeReceived in receiveFunds() is determined by _volume for ERC20 tokens or msg.value for ETH, however there is a [require check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L34)  requiring the variable _volume to be greater than 0. As msg.value is what determines amountReceived for ETH a user may not input a value for _volume and the function may revert.  

## Impact
The receiveFunds() function can revert when a user is trying to fundBountyToken(). This can cause frustration to a user and waste gas.

## Recommendation
Update [Line 34](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L34) in BountyCore.receiveFunds() to:
require(_volume != 0 || msg.value != 0, Errors.ZERO_VOLUME_SENT);
