# refund logic is unfair to funders.

## Summary
The refund logic allows some funders to retrieve much more than others.

## Vulnerability Detail
Upon calling `refundDeposit`, the maximum amount a funder can retrieve is computed using `volume[depositId]` (ie how much they deposited.
The issue is that it does not take into account other depositors, only the balance in the bounty contract.
Let us look at an example:
Suppose an outgoing bounty. Alice and Bob both deposited `1_000 MATIC`.
After a while and some claims, the issuer closes the bounty, and there is `1_000 MATIC` left in the contract.
Both Alice and Bob call `refundDeposit()`. Alice call goes through first: she gets `1_000` MATIC. Bob gets 0.

## Impact
Unfair refund logic means some funders with the same `volume` can retrieve everything while others get nothing.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The refund logic probably should take into account the total volume of deposits, and each funder would be entitled to a percentage of it based on their `volume[depositId]`
