# Bounty refunds are first come first serve

## Summary
Deposits can only be refunded once. If the bounty doesn't have enough unlocked tokens to cover the refund, the caller only gets the remaining balance. If there's more than one depositor, it incentivizes you to refund when the *other* person's deposit expires.

## Vulnerability Detail
Given that there's an OngoingBounty
1. Alice deposits 1000 tokens that expire in one week
2. Bob deposits 1000 tokens that expire in two weeks
3. One person claims the bounty and earns 100 tokens
4. Alice's deposit expires. She's able to refund 900 tokens (bounty holds 1900 tokens of which 1000 are locked)
5. Instead of refunding immediately, Alice waits for Bob's deposit to expire
6. Another person claims the bounty and earns 100 tokens
7. Bob's deposit expires
8. Alice refunds to get their full deposit back (1000 tokens)
9. Bob is now left with 800 tokens

In the end, Bob paid for the whole bounty although initially, both committed to funding it.

## Impact
Refunds being first come first serve incentivize depositors to take each other's funds. The last person to refund will be the one to cover the whole bounty

## Code Snippet
[`DepositManagerV1.refundDeposit()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L171-L179C):
```sol
        uint256 availableFunds = bounty.getTokenBalance(depToken) -
            bounty.getLockedFunds(depToken);

        uint256 volume;
        if (bounty.volume(_depositId) <= availableFunds) {
            volume = bounty.volume(_depositId);
        } else {
            volume = availableFunds;
        }
```

If the bounty was claimed, the first deposit that expires won't be fully refundable. They have to wait for other deposits to expire to get their whole deposit back.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Refunds should be done proportionally to the deposit and the remaining funds (total balance - claimed tokens)
