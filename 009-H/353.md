# Bounty issuance can be frontran

## Summary

Bounty issuers must claim a unique bountyId for their bounty. Attackers can frontrun issuance transactions and copy the victim's bounty id. This causes the victim's call to fail with `BOUNTY_ALREADY_EXISTS`

## Vulnerability Detail

The `mintBounty` function takes the `bountyId` as a parameter, leaving it open for frontrunners to mimic and force calls to fail.

## Impact

Attackers can force all calls to `mintBounty` to fail.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Instead of having bounty ids submitted directly as a parameter, have the submission be a salt. Then set the bountyId to `hash(salt+msg.sender)`. This way bountyIds cannot be copied by other accounts.
