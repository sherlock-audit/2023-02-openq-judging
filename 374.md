# Should initialize the implementation contracts

## Summary
Should initialize the implementation contract after the deployment to avoid malicious attackers. 

## Vulnerability Detail
If the implementation's initialize function is not called. There is such risk that a attacker has the chance to `selfdestruct` the implementation contract to make the whole system break. 

And OpenZeppelin team has warned about it: "There is, however, an exception. If the direct call to the logic contract triggers a `selfdestruct` operation, then the logic contract will be destroyed, and all your contract instances will end up delegating all calls to an address without any code. This would effectively break all contract instances in your project. A similar effect can be achieved if the logic contract contains a delegatecall operation. If the contract can be made to delegatecall into a malicious contract that contains a selfdestruct, then the calling contract will be destroyed."

Read [this](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable#initializing_the_implementation_contract) to know more. 

And I have noticed that in the script folder(`deploy` folder) of the repository there is no initialization of the implementation contracts. So I think this can be a problem potentially if the developer missed this.

The code below only initialize the proxy contract.

## Impact
Attacker can make the whole system break. 
In the worst case scenario, the implementation contract disappear and the protocol break. Then nothing can be changed any more.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do not leave an implementation contract uninitialized. An uninitialized implementation contract can be taken over by an attacker, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the _disableInitializers function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:

```sol
/// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
}
```

I will list up the implementation contracts which need to be initialized: 
- DepositManagerV1
- OpenQV1
- ClaimManagerV1
- AtomicBountyStorage
- OngoingBountyV1
- TieredFixedbountyV1
- TieredPercentagebountyV1
