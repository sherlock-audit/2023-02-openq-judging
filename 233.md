# There is Unchecked Integer Overflow that poses threat to PayoutVolume.

## Summary
Check properly the data type is too large for the size of the data type, and it wraps around to a negative number. In this case, the `payoutVolume` variable is declared as a "uint256" data type, which can hold values from `0 to 2^256-1`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The "setPayout" function, where the "payoutVolume" variable is defined as a `uint256`, is a type that can be vulnerable to integer overflow. Understand that when a calculation result is too large to fit within the size of the data type, causing the result to "wrap around" to a negative value or zero.

## Impact
`_payoutAddress` doesn't validate, and without checking for an integer overflow it means that if `payoutVolume` exceeds the maximum `uint256` value, it will wrap around and cause abnormal behavior.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check in the code to ensure that the value of `_payoutVolume` is within the range of a `uint256`.
For this check can be performed using an "if statement" that checks if the value of `_payoutVolume` is greater than or equal to `0` and less than or equal to `2^256-1`. 
If the value of `_payoutVolume` is not within this range, the function should not assign the value to the `payoutVolume` variable.
