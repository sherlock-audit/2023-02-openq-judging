# `TieredFixedBountyV1.closeCompetition()` doesn't check if the bounty has enough payoutSchedule balances of payoutTokenAddress

## Summary

`TieredFixedBountyV1.closeCompetition()` doesn't check if the bounty has enough payoutSchedule balances of payoutTokenAddress. The lower-ranked claimant could block the higher-ranked claimant from claiming the bounty.

## Vulnerability Detail

`ClaimManagerV1._claimTieredFixedBounty()` is a claim method for `TieredFixedBountyV1`, it calls `_bounty.closeCompetition()` to set `status` to `CLOSE`, and calls `_bounty.claimTieredFixed()` to transfer tokens.

But if the `TieredFixedBountyV1` doesn't have enough tokens, and once a claimant calls `permissionedClaimTieredBounty()` to claim the bounty, other claimants will be unable to claim due to the insufficient funds. This scenario could happen with crowdfunding for `TieredFixedBountyV1`.

Assume we have a `TieredFixedBountyV1` which has a payout schedule:
* Tier 1: 1000 USDC
* Tier 2: 500 USDC
* Tier 3: 300 USDC

But currently the `TieredFixedBountyV1` only has 1000 USDC funds. If the tier 3 claimant calls `permissionedClaimTieredBounty()`, the status will become `CLOSE`, nobody is able to call `fundBountyToken`. If the tier 1 claimant tries to call `permissionedClaimTieredBounty()`, the transaction will be reverted due to insufficient funds.

## Impact

Only some claimant could claim bounty, the lower-ranked claimant could block the higher-ranked claimant from claiming the bounty.
