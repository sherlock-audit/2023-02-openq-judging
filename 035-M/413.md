# Oracle has not been initialized in `OpenQV1` and it can be initialized more than once

## Summary

Value of `_oracle` should be set in the `initializer` of `OpenQV1` through `__Oraclize_init` which is not done. Secondly, the `__Oraclize_init` can be used to initialize more than 1 time.

## Vulnerability Detail

As you can see below in code Snippet, the initialize method doesn't initialize `Oraclize` by calling `__Oraclize_init` and setting up the `_oracle` address. 

Also, there is an access modifier missing in `__OnlyOpenQ_init` method. While initializing, `onlyInitializing` modifier is used in entire codebase to make sure that the value is initializing only during that stage. But in `__OnlyOpenQ_init` method of `OnlyOpenQ`, that modifier is missing.

## Impact

The contract will have Zero Address for `_oracle` until owner sets it up through `transferOracle`. Secondly, `_openQ` can be reinitialized in `OnlyOpenQ` which shouldn't have been the case.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: OpenQ/implementations/OpenQV1.sol

    function initialize() external initializer onlyProxy {
        __Ownable_init();
        __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
        __ReentrancyGuard_init();
    }

```
```solidity
File: OnlyOpenQ/OnlyOpenQ.sol

15:   function __OnlyOpenQ_init(address _initalOpenQ) internal {
16:       _openQ = _initalOpenQ;
17:   }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add `__Oraclize_init` in initialize method. Also, Add the `onlyInitializing` modifier in `__OnlyOpenQ_init` method.
