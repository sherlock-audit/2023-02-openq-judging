# Claim the same ongoing payouts multiple times

## Summary
Ongoing bounty allows the same claim id to withdraw the payout again.

## Vulnerability Detail
`claimOngoingPayout` does not check if the `_claimId` was already used, it always sets it to true:
```solidity
    function claimOngoingPayout(
        address _payoutAddress,
        bytes calldata _closerData
    ) external onlyClaimManager nonReentrant returns (address, uint256) {
        (, string memory claimant, , string memory claimantAsset) = abi.decode(
            _closerData,
            (address, string, address, string)
        );

        bytes32 _claimId = generateClaimId(claimant, claimantAsset);

        claimId[_claimId] = true;
```
Other types of bounties validate this when checking the eligibility, e.g.
```solidity
    function _eligibleToClaimTier(
        ITieredBounty _bounty,
        uint256 _tier,
        address _closer
    ) internal view {
        require(!_bounty.tierClaimed(_tier), Errors.TIER_ALREADY_CLAIMED);
```
But `_eligibleToClaimOngoingBounty` does not have anything that prevents repeated execution.

## Impact
The current implementation makes it possible to reuse the same claim IDs to claim the same payouts multiple times. Marked it as Medium, not High, because this function is called by oracle, so depending on the implementation there is a possibility that oracle would prevent this situation from happening.
