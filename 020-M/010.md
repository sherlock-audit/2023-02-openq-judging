# Anybody can fund bounty with worthless NFTs thereby not allowing any further NFT funding

## Summary
Anybody can use the `DepositManagerV1.fundBountyNFT` function to fund a bounty with a NFT:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L113

This function then calls `receiveNft` in the bounty contract (e.g. `AtomicBountyV1`).

The `receiveNft` function implements a limit to how many NFTs can be deposited:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/AtomicBountyV1.sol#L132-L135

This limit is currently set to `5`.

## Vulnerability Detail
So the attacker can make 5 NFT deposits thereby prohibiting any further NFT deposits.
The attacker can use worthless NFTs for this (assuming there exist worthless NFTs) to DOS the `receiveNFT` function.

## Impact
Attacker can DOS the NFT deposits such that no more NFTs can be deposited, making the bounty contract useless.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The issuer of the bounty should be able to decide who can deposit NFTs to the bounty contract.
This can be implemented by a whitelist.
