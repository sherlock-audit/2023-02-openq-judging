# Funders may be unable to supply a bounty with all the NFTs needed

## Summary

Funders may be unable to supply bounties with NFTs due to ```nftDeposits``` not decreasing when refunding.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a funder sends an NFT to a bounty using the ```receiveNFT``` function, the deposit is pushed to the ```nftDeposits``` array. To fund the bounty with an NFT, the ```receiveNFT``` function checks that the length of ```nftDeposits``` is less than ```nftDepositLimit``` which is fixed at 5. If an NFT is mistakenly sent to the bounty (with a short expiration) then refunded, the funder can now only deposit 4 NFTs instead of the 5 they expect.

This could also allow a malicious funder to front run other funders and send NFTs to the bounty contracts then refund them immediately until nftDeposits == nftDepositLimit. Other funders will then be unable to fund any NFTs.

## Impact

A malicious user could prevent a bounty contract from being funded with NFTs.
