# Volume received should not be 0

## Summary
The volume received should not be 0.

## Vulnerability Detail
It is possible that the volume received would be 0 when the token is a transfer-on-fee token and the amount is too small.

## Impact
The protocol would not receive any funding which does not make any sense

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the following code

```solidity
 function fundBountyToken(
        address _bountyAddress,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _volume,
        uint256 _expiration,
        string memory funderUuid
    ) external payable onlyProxy {
        IBounty bounty = IBounty(payable(_bountyAddress));

        if (!isWhitelisted(_tokenAddress)) {
            require(
                !tokenAddressLimitReached(_bountyAddress),
                Errors.TOO_MANY_TOKEN_ADDRESSES
            );
        }

        require(bountyIsOpen(_bountyAddress), Errors.CONTRACT_ALREADY_CLOSED);

        (bytes32 depositId, uint256 volumeReceived) = bounty.receiveFunds{
            value: msg.value
        }(msg.sender, _tokenAddress, _volume, _expiration);

        +++ require(volumeReceived > 0);

        bytes memory funderUuidBytes = abi.encode(funderUuid);

        emit TokenDepositReceived(
            depositId,
            _bountyAddress,
            bounty.bountyId(),
            bounty.organization(),
            _tokenAddress,
            block.timestamp,
            msg.sender,
            _expiration,
            volumeReceived,
            0,
            funderUuidBytes,
            VERSION_1
        );
    }
```
