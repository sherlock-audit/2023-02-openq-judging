# It is possible for a claimant to be not part of the `tierWinners[]` array to receive a tiered bounty

## Summary
`claimBounty()` can be used to claim bounty for the claimant. However, due to insufficient checks to ensure that the claimant is a tier winner, it is possible for claimant to receive bounty despite not being one.

## Vulnerability Detail
This vulnerability happens in both `_claimTieredPercentageBounty()` and `_claimTieredFixedBounty()`. When `claimBounty()` is called, we can enter either of these functions. `_eligibleToClaimTier()` is used to check the eligibility of a claim. However, this function contains 3 checks, tier must have invoice completed if required, tier must have supporting document if required, and claimant must be a KYC user. It does not check and ensure that the claimant is the corresponding tier winner as dictated by the `tierWinners[]` array.

## Impact
Claimant can be the receiver of tiered bounty despite not being a tier winner.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding the check of claimant being a tier winner as dictated by the `tierWinners[]` array when `claimBounty()` is called.
