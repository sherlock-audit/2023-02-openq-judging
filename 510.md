# Issuers of ongoing bounties can front run claims to decrease `payoutVolume`

## Summary
Issuers of ongoing bounties can rug claimers

## Vulnerability Detail
When claiming an ongoing bounty, the amount transferred to the claimer is `payoutVolume`
```solidity
File:  contracts/Bounty/Implementations/OngoingBountyV1.sol
110:         _transferToken(payoutTokenAddress, payoutVolume, _payoutAddress);
```

The issue is that this value can be changed at any time by the bounty issuer in `setPayout`.

This means claimers can get rugged by the issuer if they change `payoutVolume` right before a claim.

## Impact
`payoutVolume` acts as an incentive for developers to work on an ongoing bounty. Because of this issue, malicious bounty issuers can front-run claimers so that they receive nothing. They can even back-run the claims with another `setPayout`  call to "reset" `payoutVolume` to its previous value to try and attract more victims.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
An option could be to remove `setPayout` - ie payout is what is set on day 0, or to use a 2-step setter with a timelock (which is still messy with users who have started working on the project and will not finish by the deadline).
The best solution would be to add a requirement that `newPayoutVolume > currentPayoutVolume`: the only reason a non-malicious project would change the payout anyway is to increase it (ie give more incentive to attract more people).
