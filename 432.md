# [M-02] receivingFunds is subjected to DDOS attacks

## Summary

When receiving funds, the `receivingFunds` function allow maximum of not-yet-whitelist tokens to be deposited into the bounty.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L45-L50

A malicious account could deposit any ERC20 tokens they want into bounty with the amount of 1 wei. If they deposit number of tokens equal `TOKEN_ADDRESS_LIMIT`, the bounty will not accept any valid tokens from the issuer.


## Vulnerability Details

The `receivingFunds` function accept any ERC20 tokens and record it to `tokenAddresses` set.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L55


The length of the `tokenAddresses` set can be manipulated by any external account.


## Impact

- Issuers could not fund the bounty with their valid tokens because the number of tokens is `TOKEN_ADDRESS_LIMIT`.
- The gas cost for operations that needs to loop through `tokenAddresses` set is higher.

## Recommendation

Allow issuers to whitelist token address for their own bounty. The bounty only receives funds using whitelist tokens
