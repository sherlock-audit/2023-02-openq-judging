# Deposit Manager fails to reinforce properties set in `setFundingGoal`

## Summary 
Bounties which have a funding target set, ie,the varying tokens needed and amounts required for a specific bounty id is overlooked by the depositing manager, so any tokens (not desired by the bounty issuer will be absorbed). 
## Vulnerability Detail 
If a  Bounty issuer decides to set a specific token and volume of token to be deposited, the opposite will occur, ie, when a [token](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L36) or a [NFT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L113) is being deposited. 

## Impact 
A Bounty will be forced to accept token(s) it didn't request  as there is no check to ascertain whether a funding was/is set. If there is no such requirement made explicit by the issuer, then all token(s) (within  the [constraints](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L47) of the protocol ) and volumes should be accepted. On the contrary, if there is a special provision for selected bounties, as is mentioned [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/OpenQ/Implementations/OpenQV1.sol#L115-L116), just the token and weights stipulated should be permitted.

Below is a POC that illustrates that any and all tokens within the allowable limit (whitelisted or not will be deposited into a bounty and not the funding token specified by the Bounty issuer) :

Add to `DepositManager.test.js`

## Code Snippet

```javascript

 it('should deposit wrong token and volume ', async () => {		

// ARRANGE			

await openQProxy.mintBounty(Constants.bountyId, Constants.organization, atomicBountyInitOperation);	

const bountyAddress = await openQProxy.bountyIdToAddress(Constants.bountyId);

const bounty = await AtomicBountyV1.attach(bountyAddress);

const funding =await bounty.hasFundingGoal()	;   

   //get the token that is needed for this bounty contract 

const fundingToken= await bounty.fundingToken(); 

 const fGoal=await bounty.fundingGoal();    

  

  // ACT     

//use a token not specified by the bounty issuer , the initOperation has the mockLink token set as the funding token	
 await blacklistedMockDai.approve(bountyAddress, 10000000);

	

//await mockLink.approve(bountyAddress, 10000000);	

	

await	depositManager.fundBountyToken(bountyAddress, blacklistedMockDai.address, 1000, 1, Constants.funderUuid);	const depositId = generateDepositId(Constants.bountyId, 0);

const token = await      bounty.tokenAddress(depositId);

const volume = await bounty.volume(depositId);      

 // ASSERT	

expect(fundingToken).to.not.equal(token );   

 expect (volume).to.not.equal(fGoal);				});
```
## Tool used

Manual Review



## Recommendation
Prior to [funding](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L43) a Bounty, check whether  a  funding  goal exists or not. If it does, ensure that the token address that is utilised matches the one stipulated in `bounty.fundingToken`. 

```solidity 
if(bounty.hasFundingGoal() ) {
require(_tokenAddress==bounty.fundingToken(), ‘wrong token’ ) ;
}
```

This adjustment can also be made to `fundBountyNFT`. Additionally, check the [volume of tokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Storage/BountyStorageCore.sol#L45)(based on the deposit ids ) against the funding goal. This is to limit funding via tokens or NFTs for a bounty, if the funding threshold has been met.
