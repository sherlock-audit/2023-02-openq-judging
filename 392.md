# Blacklistable/pausable tokens can cause failures when claiming rewards

## Summary
If at least one of the bounty tokens is paused or blacklisted for the bounty winner, there will be no way to claim the rewards

## Vulnerability Detail
In ClaimManager code goes over all bounty tokens and sends them one by one to the closer. If transfer reverts for one of the tokens, the whole claim process will fail. It introduces an extra risk for the claiming process

## Impact
Claim can be impossible for certain bounties

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider the ability to partially send tokens to the winner in case some fail to transfer
