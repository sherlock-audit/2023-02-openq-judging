# Refund expiration can be bypassed

## Summary

There is no mechanism to prevent a user from setting a very short expiration meaning that anyone could invest in a PR and can get a refund whenever they want. This could particularly be bad if the refund is made right before the development is done and shipped. That would have incentivized the dev to work on the PR but he or she would eventually get paid much less than what they initially expected.

## Vulnerability Detail

The expiration can be only 1 meaning that the funds would be locked for a really short time and then the funder can get a refund at any time. This is because there is no minimum value for a refund besides the checks that are highlighted in the snippets below:

```solidity
function receiveNft(
        address _sender,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _tokenId,
        uint256 _expiration,
        bytes calldata
    ) external onlyDepositManager nonReentrant returns (bytes32) {
        require(
            nftDeposits.length < nftDepositLimit,
            Errors.NFT_DEPOSIT_LIMIT_REACHED
        );
        require(_expiration > 0, Errors.EXPIRATION_NOT_GREATER_THAN_ZERO); <===================================
        _receiveNft(_tokenAddress, _sender, _tokenId);

        bytes32 depositId = _generateDepositId();

        funder[depositId] = _sender;
        tokenAddress[depositId] = _tokenAddress;
        depositTime[depositId] = block.timestamp;
        tokenId[depositId] = _tokenId;
        expiration[depositId] = _expiration;
        isNFT[depositId] = true;

        deposits.push(depositId);
        nftDeposits.push(depositId);

        return depositId;
    }
```
The next snippet is actually the same for all bounties. I don't repeat it to keep the issue small.
```solidity
function receiveFunds(
        address _funder,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _volume,
        uint256 _expiration
    )
        external
        payable
        virtual
        onlyDepositManager
        nonReentrant
        returns (bytes32, uint256)
    {
        require(_volume != 0, Errors.ZERO_VOLUME_SENT);
        require(_expiration > 0, Errors.EXPIRATION_NOT_GREATER_THAN_ZERO); <====================================
        require(status == OpenQDefinitions.OPEN, Errors.CONTRACT_IS_CLOSED);

        bytes32 depositId = _generateDepositId();

        uint256 volumeReceived;
        if (_tokenAddress == address(0)) {
            volumeReceived = msg.value;
        } else {
            volumeReceived = _receiveERC20(_tokenAddress, _funder, _volume);
        }

        funder[depositId] = _funder;
        tokenAddress[depositId] = _tokenAddress;
        volume[depositId] = volumeReceived;
        depositTime[depositId] = block.timestamp;
        expiration[depositId] = _expiration;
        isNFT[depositId] = false;

        deposits.push(depositId);
        tokenAddresses.add(_tokenAddress);

        return (depositId, volumeReceived);
    }
```

## Impact

A funder can invest in a PR without actually locking the funds more than one second, meaning that a developer cannot know what would be the payout before it actually happens (because funders can just get a refund right before the dev is done). This is, in my opinion, disincentivizing developers to take a PR because, even when knowing how much time it would take the developer to develop a feature, he or she would not know how much they can gain given this amount of time invested.

## Recommendation

Why not allow the issuer to set a minimum expiration period for all deposits of a given bounty?
