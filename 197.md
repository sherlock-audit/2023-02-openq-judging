# Lack of method to claim NFT reward in TieredBounty and OngoingBounty via ClaimManager.sol (Invalid)

## Summary

Lack of method to claim NFT reward in TieredBounty and OngoingBounty

## Vulnerability Detail

According to 

https://docs.openq.dev/welcome/master

It is expected that the bounty funder can fund NFT and the developer can claim the NFT as reward. However, for OngoingBounty and For TieredBounty, there is a method that can receiveNFT when the user wants to fund the contrat via depositManager, but has no method to claim the NFT reward via ClaimManager.sol

```solidity
/// @notice Receives an NFT for this contract
    /// @param _sender Sender of the NFT
    /// @param _tokenAddress NFT token address
    /// @param _tokenId NFT token id
    /// @param _expiration How long before this deposit becomes refundable
    /// @return bytes32 the deposit id
    function receiveNft(
        address _sender,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _tokenId,
        uint256 _expiration,
        bytes calldata
    ) external onlyDepositManager nonReentrant returns (bytes32) {
```

Because when the claimed reward is settled, there is no option to transfer the NFT out.

```solidity
/// @notice Transfers _volume of both ERC20 or protocol token to _payoutAddress
    /// @param _tokenAddress Address of an ERC20 or Zero Address for protocol token
    /// @param _volume Volume to transfer
    /// @param _payoutAddress Destination address
    function _transferToken(
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _volume,
        address _payoutAddress
    ) internal virtual {
        if (_tokenAddress == address(0)) {
            _transferProtocolToken(_payoutAddress, _volume);
        } else {
            _transferERC20(_tokenAddress, _payoutAddress, _volume);
        }
    }
```

While the bounty issuer can reclaim the NFT refund after the expiration time passed, the developer cannot claim valuable NFT reward.

## Impact

The code allows funder to fund ongoingContract and TieredBountyContract using FNT but does not developer to claim NFT as reward.
