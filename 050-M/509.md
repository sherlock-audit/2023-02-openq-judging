# `receiveFunds()` MAY LOCK ETHER SENT TO THE CONTRACT, FOREVER

## Summary
`receiveFunds()` may lock ether sent to the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
`receiveFunds()` have code path that require Ether to be sent to them and therefore this function has the `payable` modifier. However, there are code paths within those functions that do not require Ether. Ether passed to the function, when the non-Ether code paths are taken, is locked in the contract forever, and the sender gets nothing extra in return for it.


## Impact
Ether cannot be taken out of `receiveFunds()` if the address of the `_tokenAddress` is not `_tokenAddress == address(0)`, `msg.value` should not be provided here:

```solidity
File: contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol

43        } else {
44            volumeReceived = _receiveERC20(_tokenAddress, _funder, _volume);
45        }
```
The function used `_receiveERC20` is also not rolled back for this condition.

## Tool used
Manual Review.

## Recommendation
Add a requirement `(0 == msg.value)` for the above condition.
