# receiveFunds() logic error may lead to malfunction

## Summary
receiveFunds() logic error may lead to malfunction
## Vulnerability Detail
In depositManagerV1::fundBountyToken(), some parameters will be passed to BountyCore::receiveFunds()

```solidity
(bytes32 depositId, uint256 volumeReceived) = bounty.receiveFunds{
    value: msg.value
}(msg.sender, _tokenAddress, _volume, _expiration);
```

The _volume parameter is only used if tokenaddress â‰  address(0). Used to calculate the volumereceived value.

```solidity
uint256 volumeReceived;
if (_tokenAddress == address(0)) {
    volumeReceived = msg.value;
} else {
    volumeReceived = _receiveERC20(_tokenAddress, _funder, _volume);
}
```
That is to say, when tokenaddress == address(0), the value of _volume can be 0, but BountyCore::receiveFunds() is restricted, _volume cannot be 0,

```solidity
require(_volume != 0, Errors.ZERO_VOLUME_SENT);
```
Such a design will mislead users. When tokenaddress == address(0), in order to operate normally, a meaningless _volume value must be entered.
