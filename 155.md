# BountyCore.ReceiveFunds() transfers funds from the wrong source (different from the documentation)

## Summary
``BountyCore.ReceiveFunds()`` has the NatSpec: "@notice Creates a deposit and transfers tokens from msg.sender to this contract". However, it has an inconsistent implementation: it transfers protocol tokens from ``msg.sender``, but transfers ERC20 tokens from ``_funder``. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Although ``BountyCore.ReceiveFunds()``'s NatSpec says "@notice Creates a deposit and transfers tokens from msg.sender to this contract", the implementation transfers ERC20 tokens from the ``_funder``. If the funder already sent the funds to the deposit manager to do the deposit, just like the case for protocol tokens, this might end up the funder paying twice for the bounty or a refund becomes necessary.

## Impact
The funder might pay twice for one bounty or there is a need for refund.

## Recommendation
Deposit from ``msg.sender``:
```diff
function receiveFunds(
        address _funder,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _volume,
        uint256 _expiration
    )
        external
        payable
        virtual
        onlyDepositManager
        nonReentrant
        returns (bytes32, uint256)
    {
        require(_volume != 0, Errors.ZERO_VOLUME_SENT);
        require(_expiration > 0, Errors.EXPIRATION_NOT_GREATER_THAN_ZERO);
        require(status == OpenQDefinitions.OPEN, Errors.CONTRACT_IS_CLOSED);

        bytes32 depositId = _generateDepositId();

        uint256 volumeReceived;
        if (_tokenAddress == address(0)) {
            volumeReceived = msg.value;
        } else {
-            volumeReceived = _receiveERC20(_tokenAddress, _funder, _volume);
+            volumeReceived = _receiveERC20(_tokenAddress, msg.sender, _volume);
        }

        funder[depositId] = _funder;
        tokenAddress[depositId] = _tokenAddress;
        volume[depositId] = volumeReceived;
        depositTime[depositId] = block.timestamp;
        expiration[depositId] = _expiration;
        isNFT[depositId] = false;

        deposits.push(depositId);
        tokenAddresses.add(_tokenAddress);

        return (depositId, volumeReceived);
    }
```
