# Inconsistent calcuation of token address limit

## Summary
Token address limit depends on the order in which tokens are sent to the bounty. If whitelisted tokens are added first, non-whitelisted will fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
It should be possible to fund bounty with non-whitelisted tokens. However, this may fail if whitelisted tokens are deposited first.

Function `tokenAddressLimitReached` gets the number of token addresses deposited to the bounty. This number, however, contains both whitelisted and non-whitelisted tokens. If the number of deposited whitelisted tokens reaches `TOKEN_ADDRESS_LIMIT`, it will not be possible to add non-whitelisted tokens to the bounty.

## Impact
Users may deposit some whitelisted tokens and then realize that non-whitelisted can't be added. The ones they deposited are now stuck until expiry.

## Recommendation

Only check for a number of non-whitelisted tokens deposited to the bounty when enforcing token address limit
