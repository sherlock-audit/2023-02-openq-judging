# User can claim payout multiple times in the ongoing bounty

## Summary

In the `OngoingBountyV1` contract the function `claimOngoingPayout` does not check if `claimId[_claimId] == true` and thus allows a user to claim his payout multiple times and by doing so he will be able to drain other users payouts and all the funds in the ongoing bounty contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

To claim a payout for an ongoing bounty the claiment must call the function `claimBounty` in the ClaimManagerV1 contract, this function will internally call the function `_claimOngoingBounty` in the case of ongoing bounty, the function `_claimOngoingBounty` works in the following way : 

* It first checks the eligibility of the claim with the help of `_eligibleToClaimOngoingBounty` which verify the bounty open status, invoiceComplete, supportingDocumentsComplete and kycRequired but it does not verify if the user has already claimed his payout or not.

* Then if eligible the function calls the `claimOngoingPayout` function in the `OngoingBountyV1` contract, this function also does not verify if the user has already claimed his payout or not, instead it sets `claimId[_claimId]` to true regardless of its old value (if it was already true)  and immediately transfer the payout tokens to the user.

Thus a user can use the same `claimant` and `claimantAsset` values to claim payouts multiple times until all the funds has been drained from the bounty contract.

## Impact

User can claim payouts multiple times and drain all the funds from the ongoing bounty contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To avoid this issue the `claimOngoingPayout` function (in the  OngoingBountyV1 contract) must contain a check to verify that `claimId[_claimId] != true` when a claiment tries to collect his payout, and thus the claim will be collected only once, the function should be updated as follow :

```solidity
function claimOngoingPayout(
    address _payoutAddress,
    bytes calldata _closerData
) external onlyClaimManager nonReentrant returns (address, uint256) {
    (, string memory claimant, , string memory claimantAsset) = abi.decode(
        _closerData,
        (address, string, address, string)
    );

    bytes32 _claimId = generateClaimId(claimant, claimantAsset);
    
    
    /** @audit
        check claim status and revert if already claimed
    */
    require(!claimId[_claimId],Errors.ALREADY_CLAIMED);

    claimId[_claimId] = true;
    claimIds.push(_claimId);

    _transferToken(payoutTokenAddress, payoutVolume, _payoutAddress);
    return (payoutTokenAddress, payoutVolume);
}
```
