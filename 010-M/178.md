# Function `OngoingBountyV1.claimOngoingPayout()` should check `!claimId[_claimId]` before claiming rewards.

## Summary
Function `OngoingBountyV1.claimOngoingPayout()` should check `!claimId[_claimId]` to avoid a payout be claimed more than one. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Mapping `OngoingBountyStorageV1.claimId` is used to check if a claimId is completed payout or not. Since there is no check if `claimId[_claimId] == false` before executing `OngoingBountyV1.claimOngoingPayout()`, a claimId can be paid more than one. 
```solidity=
function claimOngoingPayout(
    address _payoutAddress,
    bytes calldata _closerData
) external onlyClaimManager nonReentrant returns (address, uint256) {
    (, string memory claimant, , string memory claimantAsset) = abi.decode(
        _closerData,
        (address, string, address, string)
    );

    bytes32 _claimId = generateClaimId(claimant, claimantAsset);
    
    /// [!note] no check claimId[_claimId] == false here 
    claimId[_claimId] = true;
    claimIds.push(_claimId);

    _transferToken(payoutTokenAddress, payoutVolume, _payoutAddress);
    return (payoutTokenAddress, payoutVolume);
}
```
This can incur some potential risk for the bounty if there are some mistakes from the `oracle`. One of the bad scenario can be: 

0. `bytes32[] public claimIds` is a keys of claims, can be used off-chain as an iterable to determine completed payouts following the explaination in [`OngoingBountyStorage.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Storage/OngoingBountyStorage.sol#L21-L22). The oracle will loop through this array to get a list claimed `claimId` and exclude them. 
1. Oracle call `ClaimManager.claimBounty()` with `claimId = 1`
2. During the time the tx (1) is in transactions pool (confirmed but not mined yet), the oracle loops through the `claimIds[]` again to get the new excluded `claimId`. But the tx (1) hasn't mined yet, the oracle call `ClaimManager.claimBounty()` with `claimId = 1` again 
==> the claimId = 1 is paid 2 times. 

## Impact
Competitors can be paid more than they expected while another competitors can't be paid because of not enough fund.

## Tool used
Manual review 

## Recommendation
check whether the `claimId[_claimId]` is false before executing the payout.
