# OngoingBountyV1.claimOngoingPayout should check that claimId has not already been claimed before

## Summary
The `OngoingBountyV1.claimOngoingPayout` function is called by the `ClaimManagerV1` contract to claim payouts.
Each `claimant`, `claimantAsset` pair from which the `claimId` is generated should only be claimed once.

The `claimOngoingPayout` function sets `claimId[_claimId]` to `true` which means that the payout has been claimed:

However there is no check that the `claimId` has not already been claimed before.
Also there is no such check in the `ClaimManagerV1` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
Since the `claimOngoingPayout` function does not check that the `claimId` has not already been claimed, it can potentially be claimed multiple times leading to a gain for some users and a loss for others.

## Impact
`claimId`s can be claimed multiple times which leads a gain for some users and loss to other users for which there are not enough funds available to claim anymore.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
In the `OngoingBountyV1.claimOngoingPayout` function it should be required that `!claimId[_claimId]` such that a `claimId` can only be claimed once.
