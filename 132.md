# A claiming contract not implementing ERC721Receiver can be made to revert by an NFT funder

## Summary
On TieredFixedBounty and TieredPercentageBounty, any user can associate a whitelisted NFT reward with the paymentToken reward. Unfortunately this may revert the whole payment if the receiving address is a contract but not an ERC721Receiver.

## Vulnerability Detail
If we take the simpler example of an atomic bounty:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/ClaimManager/Implementations/ClaimManagerV1.sol#L123-L166

A malicious user could detect that the closer is trying to claim the bounty with a contract which is not an ERC721Receiver and block his payment by funding the bounty with an NFT.

## Impact
Bounty admin has to take control and either:
- change the winner (tiered bounties)
- call claim again with a different closer for AtomicBounty

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do not fail on transfer of NFTs (use try/catch), eventually the nft depositor can have his NFT refunded.

Please note that this scenario is different from #1, since in this case the nft stays in the contract. So the grieving described here should be possible even if #1 is fixed and `nftDeposits` is updated correctly.
