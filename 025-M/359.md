# `__gap` is not used in the contracts

## Summary

There are risks if `__gap` is not added in the contracts for future upgrading activities. 

## Vulnerability Detail

If `__gap` is not added in the contract, then there are some risks in the future when the upgradable contracts are not well thought and well implemented. 

As [this](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/upgradeable#storage_gaps) mentioned, This is empty reserved space in storage that is put in place in Upgrade Safe contracts. 

it isn’t safe to simply add a state variable because it "shifts down" all of the state variables below in the inheritance chain. This makes the storage layouts incompatible, as explained in [Writing Upgradeable Contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable#modifying-your-contracts).

Above contracts are ones which should add `__gap`. 

## Impact

Storage gaps are a convention for reserving storage slots in a base contract, allowing future versions of that contract to use up those slots without affecting the storage layout of child contracts. 

Without it, there is safety concern of properly conducting the upgradeability implementation and makes the upgrading process complex. 

So it is recommended that developers implement this and follow the best practice.

## Tool used

- Manual Review

## Recommendation

Adding the line in the contracts for safety reason and future ease of upgrading the smart contracts. (`UUPSUpgradeable`, `OwnableUpgradeable` and `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable` are the contracts of OpenZeppelin, which included `__gap` implementation. They are also in the `OpenQ` code base. )

```solidity
contract ContractWithGap {
	// ...state variables
	// ...functions, etc
	uint256[49] __gap;
}
```
