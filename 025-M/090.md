# Missing storage gap for upgradeable contract might lead to storage slot collision

## Summary
For upgradeable contracts, there should be storage gap to “allow developers to freely add new state variables in the future without compromising the storage compatibility with existing deployments” (quote [openZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable#storage_gaps)). Otherwise it will be hard to write new implementation code. 

## Vulnerability Detail
There are several contracts intended to be upgradeable and working as base contract but without storage gap, including
- AtomicBountyStorageV1
- BountyStorageCore
- OngoingBountyStorageV1
- TieredBountyStorageCore
- TieredFixedBountyStorageV1
- TieredPercentageBountyStorageV1
- ClaimManagerStorageV1
- DepositManagerStorageV1

## Impact
Without storage gap, the variable in child contract might be overwritten by the upgraded base contract if new variables are added to the base contract. This could have unintended and serious consequences to the child contracts, potentially causing loss of user fund or cause the contract to malfunction completely.
