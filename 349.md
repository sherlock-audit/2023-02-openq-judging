# Funds deposited into bounties may be lost.

## Summary

Issued bounties may be funded via the deposit manager'a `fundBountyToken()` function. This function is used to deposit eth and ERC20 tokens. If a user specifies an ERC20 and also sends raw eth in the same call, the deposit manager sends both along to the bounty. However, the bounty will ignore the eth in this case and only credit the depositor with the ERC20.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Deposit Manager helper contract allows dual deposits of ERC20s and raw eth in the same call.

However the BountyCore contract which defines the `receiveFunds` function for all bounties ignores raw eth in dual bounties and only recognizes the ERC20 deposit.

## Impact

In dual deposits, all funds deposited in the form of raw eth are lost.

## Recommendation

Either add logic to properly recognize dual deposits in BountyCore or reject dual deposits in the deposit manager.
