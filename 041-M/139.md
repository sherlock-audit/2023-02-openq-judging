# Attacker can steal victim bounty

## Summary
For bounty where KYC is not required (common in web3), attacker can steal victim bounty as shown in POC

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Assume a new Atomic bounty is running and User U1 is working on it
2. Once the task is complete, User U1 can claim the bounty using `claimBounty`
3. Before U1 can call, Attacker calls the `claimBounty` function with (Assuming victim github oauth was compromised and Attacker initiated Oracle `claimBounty` with his own param on Victim behalf)

```solidity
_closer = attacker address
```

4. Since there is no check made on `_closerData` in `_eligibleToClaimAtomicBounty` function, so attacker claim is accepted (Victim has already completed the supporting docs and KYC was not required)

```solidity
function _eligibleToClaimAtomicBounty(IAtomicBounty bounty, address _closer)
        internal
        view
    {
        require(
            bounty.status() == OpenQDefinitions.OPEN,
            Errors.CONTRACT_IS_NOT_CLAIMABLE
        );

        if (bounty.invoiceRequired()) {
            bool _invoiceComplete = abi.decode(
                bounty.getInvoiceComplete(),
                (bool)
            );
            require(_invoiceComplete, Errors.INVOICE_NOT_COMPLETE);
        }

        if (bounty.supportingDocumentsRequired()) {
            bool _supportingDocumentsComplete = abi.decode(
                bounty.getSupportingDocumentsComplete(),
                (bool)
            );
            require(
                _supportingDocumentsComplete,
                Errors.SUPPORTING_DOCS_NOT_COMPLETE
            );
        }

        if (bounty.kycRequired()) {
            require(hasKYC(_closer), Errors.ADDRESS_LACKS_KYC);
        }
    }
```

5. Thus the whole bounty meant for User U1 will now move to attacker address

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < _bounty.getTokenAddresses().length; i++) {
            uint256 volume = _bounty.claimBalance(
                _closer,
                _bounty.getTokenAddresses()[i]
            );
...
```

## Impact
Victim will lose the bounty funds even after completing the task

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a new check in `_eligibleToClaimAtomicBounty` to confirm whether the user claiming bounty is actually the user completing the task. One example way is using `bytes32 claimId = bounty.generateClaimId(claimant, claimantAsset); bounty.supportingDocumentsComplete(claimId)...` (like done in Ongoing bounty)

Note: This issue also holds for Tier bounty which also have weak validation
