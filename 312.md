# A claimant can claim an ongoing payout multiple times.

## Summary

There is no check in OngoingBountyv1.sol’s `claimOngoingPayout` function if the bounty is already paid or not, this may lead to a claimant calling this function multiple times. 

## Vulnerability Detail

When a closer calls `claimBounty` for ONGOING type of bounty, this function will call `_claimOngoingBounty` . This function will check eligiblity status by checking a few things, but it misses if the claimId has already been claimed. 

The above function will then call `claimOngoingPayout` in `OngoingBountyV1.sol`. This function also misses the same check, i.e., if the claimId has already been claimed. This may lead to claimId been claimed multiple times by a single closer and thus taking all the funds from the contract leaving no funds for other closers. 

The POC is here, I updated the original ONGOING→TRANSFER test case to this: 

Here the `claimant.address` is claiming the bounty two times. Rather, they should only be able to call this one time.

```solidity
describe('TRANSFER', () => {
				it('should transfer payoutAmount from bounty pool to claimant', async () => {
					// ARRANGE
					const volume = 1000;
					const expectedTimestamp = await setNextBlockTimestamp();

					await openQProxy.mintBounty(Constants.bountyId, Constants.organization, ongoingBountyInitOperation);

					const bountyIsOpen = await openQProxy.bountyIsOpen(Constants.bountyId);
					const bountyAddress = await openQProxy.bountyIdToAddress(Constants.bountyId);

					const newBounty = await OngoingBountyV1.attach(
						bountyAddress
					);

					await mockLink.approve(bountyAddress, 10000000);

					await depositManager.fundBountyToken(bountyAddress, mockLink.address, volume, 1, Constants.funderUuid);

					// ACT

					await claimManager.connect(oracle).claimBounty(bountyAddress, claimant.address, abiEncodedOngoingCloserData);
					await claimManager.connect(oracle).claimBounty(bountyAddress, claimant.address, abiEncodedOngoingCloserData);

					// ASSERT
					const newBountyMockTokenBalance = (await mockLink.balanceOf(bountyAddress)).toString();
					expect(newBountyMockTokenBalance).to.equal('800');

					const newClaimerMockTokenBalance = (await mockLink.balanceOf(claimant.address)).toString();
					expect(newClaimerMockTokenBalance).to.equal('200');
				});
```

## Impact

A claimant can claim an ongoing payout multiple times, they can empty the contract and others won’t be able to claim their bounty anymore.

> Note: Although this function is protected by onlyOracle modifier, I’d still consider this fixable. I discussed with the protocol developers and they considered it a valid bug hence reporting it.

## Code Snippet

[`OngoingBountyV1.sol:claimOngoingPayout`
](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/OngoingBountyV1.sol#L96)

```solidity
function claimOngoingPayout(
        address _payoutAddress,
        bytes calldata _closerData
    ) external onlyClaimManager nonReentrant returns (address, uint256) {
        (, string memory claimant, , string memory claimantAsset) = abi.decode(
            _closerData,
            (address, string, address, string)
        );

        bytes32 _claimId = generateClaimId(claimant, claimantAsset);

        claimId[_claimId] = true; //@audit This is not checked later anywhere?
        claimIds.push(_claimId);

        _transferToken(payoutTokenAddress, payoutVolume, _payoutAddress);
        return (payoutTokenAddress, payoutVolume);
    }
```

## Recommendation

In the function `claimOngoingPayout` revert if `claimId[_claimId]` is true.
