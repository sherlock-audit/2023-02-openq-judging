# New Bounty can be minted with zero address for `claimManager` and `depositManager`

## Summary

In `OpenQ` contract, `mintBounty` method passes `claimManager` and `depositManager` as parameters for `mintBounty` function in `BountyFacotry` which can be zero address initially.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `OpenQ` contract, owner is required to set claim Manager and deposit Manager. But till the time those 2 are set, all mintBounty function will go ahead with zero address for `claimManager` and `depositManager`.

## Impact

The User won't be able to use functionalities which can be accessed only through `claimManager` and `depositManager`.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: OpenQ/implementations/OpenQV1.sol

36:    address bountyAddress = bountyFactory.mintBounty(
            _bountyId,
            msg.sender,
            _organization,
            claimManager,
            depositManager,
            _initOperation
43:     );

73:   function setClaimManager(address _claimManager)
          external
          onlyProxy
          onlyOwner
      {
          claimManager = _claimManager;
79:   }

83:   function setDepositManager(address _depositManager)
          external
          onlyProxy
          onlyOwner
      {
          depositManager = _depositManager;
89:   }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to deploy Claim Manager and Deposit Manager first and set the `claimManager` and `depositManager` addresses in `initialize()` method itself to prevent this issue.
