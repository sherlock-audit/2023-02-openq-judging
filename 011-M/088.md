# `OngoingBounty` accepts Nfts, but has no way of paying users with the Nfts

## Summary
`OngoingBounty` type bounties have the function `receiveNft()` implemented, allowing the contract to receive Nfts and lock them in a timelock, but have no way to reward users with those Nfts.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function `receiveNft()` is implemented in both Atomic and Ongoing bounties.

However, this is deceiving since the contract does not have the necessary functionality in the `ClaimManager` function to distribute these Nfts. This causes the Nfts to get locked up until expiry and of being no use.
## Impact
Locked Nfts until expiry timestamp

## Recommendation
Delete `receiveNft()` or make the function revert, to prevent them from taking NFTs as deposits
