# The `OngoingBountyV1` contract can receive NFTs that cannot be claimed

## Summary
The `OngoingBountyV1` contract type can receive NFTs which can never be claimed later on.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `OngoingBountyV1` intent to receive NFTs for these reasons:

- It defines a `nftDepositLimit` variable in the `initialize` function.
- It defines a `receiveNft` function.

Plus, the usage of NFTs can be done for rewarding several times the same NFT for the same task completion. Which is a valid scenario for an ongoing bounty type.

However, when `claimBounty` is called `_claimOngoingBounty` doesn't allow for NFT claims:
[ClaimManagerV1.sol#L173-L197](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/ClaimManager/Implementations/ClaimManagerV1.sol#L173-L197)
```solidity
    function _claimOngoingBounty(
        IOngoingBounty _bounty,
        address _closer,
        bytes calldata _closerData
    ) internal {
        _eligibleToClaimOngoingBounty(_bounty, _closer, _closerData);


        (address tokenAddress, uint256 volume) = _bounty.claimOngoingPayout(
            _closer,
            _closerData
        );


        emit TokenBalanceClaimed(
            _bounty.bountyId(),
            address(_bounty),
            _bounty.organization(),
            _closer,
            block.timestamp,
            tokenAddress,
            volume,
            _bounty.bountyType(),
            _closerData,
            VERSION_1
        );
    }
```

## Impact
A scenario that would have been considered valid according to the protocol is prevented due to the absence of a crucial protocol functionality. Additionally, anyone that deploy a contract with a NFT address as `_payoutTokenAddress` will need to redeploy a contract without NFT address as reward for his bounty.

## Recommendation
I recommend adding the ability to claim NFTs by calling `claimNft` in `_claimOngoingBounty` and by checking a flag `isNFT` defined during the initialization.
