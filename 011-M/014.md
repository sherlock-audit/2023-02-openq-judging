# OngoingBountyV1 contract should not implement receiveNft function because NFT cannot be paid out

## Summary
The `OngoingBountyV1` contract implements the `receiveNft` function:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/OngoingBountyV1.sol#L133-L139

However there is not possibility of NFT rewards to be paid out.

This means that the NFTs are stuck within the contract until the expiration time is reached and they can get refunded.

## Vulnerability Detail
You can see that the `ClaimManagerV1._claimOngoingBounty` function which is used to claim rewards from the `OngoingBountyV1` contract does not claim any NFTs.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/ClaimManager/Implementations/ClaimManagerV1.sol#L173-L197

It only calls `_bounty.claimOngoingPayout` which does only transfer ERC20 or native tokens but not NFTs.

## Impact
NFTs received by the `OngoingBountyV1` contract are temporarily stuck.
