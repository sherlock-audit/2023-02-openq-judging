# NFT deposited into OngoingBountyV1 are not distributed to users

## Summary
NFTs that were deposited into the OngoingBountyV1 contract are not distributed by the ClaimManagerV1 contract. The feature is unusable with that bounty type. This impacts the reward payout of users who completed the bounty.

## Vulnerability Detail
Deposited NFTs are distributed by the ClaimManagerV1 contract. But, not for OngoingBountyV1 bounties.

## Impact
Any NFT deposited won't be claimable by users. After the deposit expired, the funder will be able to withdraw their NFT.

## Code Snippet
In `ClaimManagerV1._claimOngoingBounty()` only the ERC20 payout is executed: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/ClaimManager/Implementations/ClaimManagerV1.sol#L173
```sol
    function _claimOngoingBounty(
        IOngoingBounty _bounty,
        address _closer,
        bytes calldata _closerData
    ) internal {
        _eligibleToClaimOngoingBounty(_bounty, _closer, _closerData);

        (address tokenAddress, uint256 volume) = _bounty.claimOngoingPayout(
            _closer,
            _closerData
        );

        emit TokenBalanceClaimed(
            _bounty.bountyId(),
            address(_bounty),
            _bounty.organization(),
            _closer,
            block.timestamp,
            tokenAddress,
            volume,
            _bounty.bountyType(),
            _closerData,
            VERSION_1
        );
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the NFT distribution logic to the `_claimOngoingBounty()` function.
