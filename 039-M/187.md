# The expiration time for bounty refund can be gamed in DepositManager.sol

## Summary

The expiration time for bounty refund can be gamed in DepositManager.sol

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation, when the user fund a bug bounty, the user can choose the expiration timestamp:

```solidity
function fundBountyToken(
  address _bountyAddress,
  address _tokenAddress,
  uint256 _volume,
  uint256 _expiration,
  string memory funderUuid
) external payable onlyProxy {
```

After the expiration seconds passed, the user can choose to refund the deposit,

```solidity
function refundDeposit(address _bountyAddress, bytes32 _depositId)
    external
    onlyProxy
{
```

The issue is that the user can set the expiration to very short and small number so the user can claim the refund immediately or anytime in the future before the eligible developer can claim the bounty.

Consider this case:

1. User A supply 100 USDC as bounty, and set expiration time to 1 seconds.
2. User B the developer complete the PR and wants to claim the 100 USDC bounty.
3. User A front-run user Bâ€™s claim transaction and get the refunded 100 USDC or User A just refund after User B complete the task. Note that the User does not have to come from the project team, it could be just any user that supplies the bounty but change his mind and may wants to take the advantage of the developer B.

## Impact

Developer B failed to claim the entitled bounty because User A set expiration time too short and claim the refund.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend set a fixed window for developer B to claim the bounty instead of letting the bounty supplier set the expiration time. For example: After 1 week, if the developer does not claim the bounty, the bounty fund supplies can claim the fund back.
