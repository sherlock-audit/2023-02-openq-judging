# Unsecured msg.value access resulting in unexpected Behavior

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L42

## Summary
Potential issue may rise from unauthorized or unintentional changes to the `msg.value` property .

## Vulnerability Detail
In the code, the `msg.value `property is used to store the amount of Ether sent with a transaction that calls the `receiveFunds `function. If an attacker is able to change the  `msg.value` before the function is executed, he will be able also to change the amount of Ether recorded and then potentially cause the serious issue.

## Recommendation

For this why, We can checks to ensure that the `msg.value `property is only modified by trusted sources and that its value is within the expected range.

```solidity
require(msg.value >= minimumDepositAmount, Errors.INSUFFICIENT_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT);
volumeReceived = msg.value;
```
