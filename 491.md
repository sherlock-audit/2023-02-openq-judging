# Inherited contracts should have gap storage slots

## Summary

The upgradable contracts inherit a storage contract. But some contracts which are inherited by the storage contract have no gap storage slots, exposing these bounties to the risk of potential storage overlap/corruption in future upgrades.

## Vulnerability Detail

A common problem in upgradeable/proxy contracts is mismanagement of storage layout, which boils down to overlap of different storage slots and potential type confusion.

The general way to avoid this is to define spare gap slots in each inherited contract to allow future upgrades to utilize those slots without having storage overlap with child contracts.

`BountyStorageCore` inherits `OnlyOpenQ`, `ClaimManagerOwnable` and `DepositManagerOwnable`, which does not have any gap slots prepared for potential upgrades. Thus exposing them to the risk of storage corruption upon future upgrades where additional variables need to be added to `OnlyOpenQ`, `ClaimManagerOwnable` and `DepositManagerOwnable`.

The same issue in `OpenQV1`. `OpenQStorageV1` inherits `Oraclize` but `Oraclize` does not have any gap slots.

## Impact

Future upgrade may result in overlap of storages of other inherited contracts, corrupting the state of bounty contracts and `OpenQV1` and potentially lead to loss of contract users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add spare slots in `OnlyOpenQ`, `ClaimManagerOwnable`, `DepositManagerOwnable` and `Oraclize `:

```solidity
uint256[60] private __gap;
```

Here is spare slots example in [AccessControlUpgradeable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/v4.7.3/contracts/access/AccessControlUpgradeable.sol#L259).
