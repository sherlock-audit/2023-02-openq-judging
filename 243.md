# Unable to set invoice complete if there were too many contributions

## Summary

Each payout of an ongoing bounty gets recorded into an array and since `getInvoiceComplete()` encodes data that grows linearly with the number of contributors, it might render the function `setInvoiceComplete` unusable.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
function setInvoiceComplete(string calldata _bountyId, bytes calldata _data)
        external
        onlyProxy
    {
        IBounty bounty = getBounty(_bountyId);

        require(
            msg.sender == bounty.issuer() || msg.sender == _oracle,
            Errors.CALLER_NOT_ISSUER_OR_ORACLE
        );

        bounty.setInvoiceComplete(_data); <================================================ this grows the array by one item.

        emit InvoiceCompleteSet(
            address(bounty),
            bounty.bountyType(),
            bounty.getInvoiceComplete(), <================================================= the cost in gas depends on the number of items in the claimIds array.
            VERSION_1
        );
    }
```

As you can see below, each claimId get appended to the array here

```solidity
function setInvoiceComplete(bytes calldata _data) external onlyOpenQ {
        (bytes32 _claimId, bool _invoiceComplete) = abi.decode(
            _data,
            (bytes32, bool)
        );
        invoiceComplete[_claimId] = _invoiceComplete;
        invoiceCompleteClaimIds.push(_claimId);
    }
```

and here we encode the array

```solidity
function getInvoiceComplete() external view returns (bytes memory) {
        return abi.encode(invoiceCompleteClaimIds);
    }
```

It might no be so likely to happen but this might break the invoicing which might end up badly legally in terms of accounting.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Don't encode the array in the event if possible. Do you really need to encode the entire array in every call to `setInvoiceComplete`?
- If yes, having a max number of contribution for a given bounty might be a solution.
