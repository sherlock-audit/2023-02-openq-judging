# `refundDeposit` may fail due to the gas limit DoS of `bounty.getLockedFunds(depToken)`

## Summary

An attacker could maliciously increase the length of `deposits` array to become a large length, causing anyone being unable to call `refundDeposit()` due to the gas limit DoS of `bounty.getLockedFunds(depToken)` in `refundDeposit()`.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `BountyCore.getLockedFunds()`:

```solidity
    function getLockedFunds(address _depositId)
        public
        view
        virtual
        returns (uint256)
    {
        uint256 lockedFunds;
        bytes32[] memory depList = this.getDeposits();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < depList.length; i++) {
            if (
                block.timestamp <
                depositTime[depList[i]] + expiration[depList[i]] &&
                tokenAddress[depList[i]] == _depositId
            ) {
                lockedFunds += volume[depList[i]];
            }
        }

        return lockedFunds;
    }
```

`getLockedFunds()` loops `deposits` array to calculate `lockedFunds`. But if the length of `deposits` is too big, it will exhaust all the gas and revert the transaction.

In addition, `refundDeposit()` uses `getLockedFunds()` to calculate `availableFunds`, the `refundDeposit()` will always be reverted due to the gas limit DoS.

An attacker could maliciously increase the length of `deposits` array to become a large length, causing anyone being unable to call `refundDeposit()`.

## Impact

Nobody is able to refund due to the gas limit DoS. The attacker just needs to pay a little money (for example, 1 wei for each deposit) and the cheap gas fee of Polygon to exploit this vulnerability.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a mapping for whitelist token and volume threshold, and check the `_volume` threshold in `fundBountyToken`. For example, users must fund at least 10 USDC each time.
