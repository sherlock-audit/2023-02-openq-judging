# Adversary can brick refunds by making a large number of small deposits

## Summary

Refunds call bounty.getLockedFunds which loops through every deposit that has taken place. Since the number of deposits are not limited, an adversary can make a large number of very small deposits. When looping through all the deposits it will cause an out-of-gas error making refunds impossible.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L171-L181

To determine the amount of available funds DepositManagerV1#refundDeposit makes a subcall to bountyCore#getLockedFunds.

getLockedFunds pulls EVERY deposit and loops through each one. Since the number of deposits are not limited, an adversary can make a large number of very small deposits. When looping through all the deposits it will cause an out-of-gas error making refunds impossible.

Submitting as high risk because when combined with payout breaking methods it will result in all deposited tokens being stuck forever.

## Impact

Adversary can permanently break refunds

There's no easy solution to fix this without either removing the permissionless nature of funding the bounties or completely redesigning the funding mechanism.
