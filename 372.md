# logic error with uninitialized state variables [ expiration ]

## Summary
expiration is a time restriction as a requirement to return the deposit. but in this case expiration is not set as a time restriction (never initialized).

## Vulnerability Detail
to return the asset after deposit, the refundDeposit function requires an expiration of 
```solidity
requires (
            block.timestamp >=
                bounty.depositTime(_depositId) + bounty.expiration(_depositId),
```
expiration is obtained from the ``receiveFunds`` function in the bountycore contract by entering the expiration value.
```solidity
function receiveFunds(
        address_funds,
        address_token,
        uint256 _volume,
=> uint256 _expiration
    )
 ```
This is called from the depositManagerV1 contract to make a deposit, the functions to make a deposit in the depositManagerV1 contract all require the expiration value to be filled in.

That is the vulnerability, whoever is making the deposit can set the ``expiration`` value at will, and do a ``refundDeposit`` with the ``expiration`` duration filled at will in the deposit function.

Example:
1. andy calls ``fundBountyToken`` input the ``expiration`` value (1) and then,
andy calls ``refundDeposit`` and the ``expiration`` value obtained is as follows: 
```
bounty.expiration(_depositId)=(1) 
```

2. Jhon calls ``fundBountyToken`` input the ``expiration`` value (1000) and then,
Jhon calls ``refundDeposit`` and the ``expiration`` value obtained is as follows: 
```
bounty.expiration(_depositId)=(1000) 
```

## Impact
whoever is making the deposit can set the ``expiration`` value at will, and do a ``refundDeposit`` with the ``expiration`` duration filled at will in the deposit function.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
initialized ``expiration`` 
example :
expiration = 3 day after deposit 

do not give access to other to fill in the expiration duration,
so remove functions that require expiration values like this :
```solidity 
  function fundBountyNFT(
        address _bountyAddress,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _tokenId,
=>   uint256 _expiration,  // remove this //
        bytes calldata _data
