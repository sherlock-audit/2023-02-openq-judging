# Remaining funds cannot be refunded after partial refund

## Summary
Deposits to bounties can be refunded via the `DepositManagerV1.refundDeposit` function.

The amount to be refunded is capped at the `availableFunds` amount:

And refunding can occur only once. This is since `BountyCore.refundDeposit` checks that the `depositId` has not already been refunded:

## Vulnerability Detail
Think of the following situation:
Funder A has deposited 500 USDC.
Funder A wants to refund his deposits but only 200 USDC are available so he receives only 200 USDC.

Now he is unable to refund the remaining 300 USDC which he loses.

Also if this amount is not claimed it is stuck in the contract.

It should be possible for a funder to refund the remaining funds after a partial refund once the remaining funds become available.

## Impact
Funders lose remaining funds after a partial refund and funds can get stuck in the bounty contract.
