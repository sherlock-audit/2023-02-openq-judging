# Payout schedule cannot be shrunk due to a revert

## Summary
Trying to reduce the length of the payouts schedule in the tiered bounty contract will always revert. Asa result, bounty minters cannot reduce the number of tiers.
## Vulnerability Detail
The [TieredPercentageBountyV1.setPayoutSchedule](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/TieredPercentageBountyV1.sol#L141) and [TieredFixedBountyV1.setPayoutScheduleFixed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/TieredFixedBountyV1.sol#L138) functions let bounty minters change the payment schedules of the tiered bounties. They can be used to reduce or increase the number of tiers. However, when reducing the number of tiers, there will always be a revert: writing current tier winners to `newTierWinners` will revert with an "Index out of bounds" error due to `newTierWinners` being shorter than `tierWinners`.

This also applies to the `newInvoiceComplete` and `newSupportingDocumentsCompleted` variables in the functions.
## Impact
Bounty minters cannot reduce the number of tiers if tiered bounty contracts.

## Recommendation
When shrinking the list of tiers, consider checking that the short list is not access at an index outside of its boundaries.
