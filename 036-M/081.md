# Issuer can front-run claimTieredFixed() and change payoutTokenAddress

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently, a tiered bounty will be claimed when the Oracle calls the `ClaimManagerV1.claimBounty()`. This call, in turn, calls `TieredFixedBountyV1.claimTieredFixed()` and transfers the `payoutTokenAddress` token to the `_payoutAddress`. However, an issuer can potentially front-run the claim by calling `setFundingGoal()` and setting a different payout token. 

This has a similar issue with ongoing bounties.

## Impact
This results in the winner receiving a different from expected payout token. The impact is a potential loss of trust in bounties.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider restricting `setFundingGoal()` such that it does not set `payoutTokenAddress` when it has already been set.
