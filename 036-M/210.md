# Funding token can be changed at any time for tiered fixed bounties

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
In OpenQV1.sol, an issuer can call `setFundingGoal` to update the funding goal. For tired fixed bounties, `TieredFixedBountyV1.setFundingGoal()` is called, which also updates the `payoutTokenAddress`. This is problematic because a rouge issuer can potentially front-run a claim by updating this to a useless token. This can can contribute to a loss of trust to the OpenQ bounty system.

## Impact

## Code Snippet
`payoutTokenAddress` is updated here:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Consider preventing `payoutTokenAddress` from being updated at some point in the bounty (possibly when it has closed).
