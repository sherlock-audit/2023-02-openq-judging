# `claimOngoingPayout()` allows claimers to claim the same `claimId` twice

## Summary
A user can claim an outgoing bounty with the same `claimId` twice.

## Vulnerability Detail
`claimOngoingPayout()` generates the claim id of a claimant, and sets its `claimId` mapping to true, before paying the claimant

```solidity
File: contracts/Bounty/Implementations/OngoingBountyV1.sol
96:     function claimOngoingPayout(
97:         address _payoutAddress,
98:         bytes calldata _closerData
99:     ) external onlyClaimManager nonReentrant returns (address, uint256) {
100:         (, string memory claimant, , string memory claimantAsset) = abi.decode(
101:             _closerData,
102:             (address, string, address, string)
103:         );
104: 
105:         bytes32 _claimId = generateClaimId(claimant, claimantAsset);
106: 
107:         claimId[_claimId] = true;
108:         claimIds.push(_claimId);
109:             
110:         _transferToken(payoutTokenAddress, payoutVolume, _payoutAddress);
```

The issue is that there is no check that the `_claimId` has already been claimed or not.
This means a claimId can be claimed multiple times.

While the function call is made by the oracle, which is an Open Zeppelin Defender Autotask, there is no built-in check in there that the request has gone through already (quoting the sponsor form Discord: "the logic for this claimBounty method runs on our oracle, and it checks that the caller has a signed Github OAuth token representing the person who wrote a certain merged pull request"), so a claimant can submit two requests and they would go through

## Impact
A claimant can "double-dip" their rewards.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a `require(claimId[_claimID] == false)` check to `claimOngoingPayout`.
If you want to allow claimants to be able to make more than one submission for an ongoing payout, refactor the `_claimId` logic to include an extra parameter (a nonce for instance, or a string related to the PR they submitted) to prevent double-dipping.
