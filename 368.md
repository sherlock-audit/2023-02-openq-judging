# Multiple claimant addresses can be set to be the winner of a tier, but only the first claimant will be able to claim

## Summary
Issuer can set tier winners via `setTierWinner()`. Multiple users can be set to be winners of the same tier. However, each tier is only allowed one winner, hence only first claimant can claim sucessfully.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the tier bounties, each tier is claimable only once. The issuer is able to set multiple winners for the same tier via `setTierWinner()`. Should this happen, an unneccessary race condition is forced as only the first claimant can claim.

## Impact
Only first claimant can claim rewards of a tier is there are multiple winners set.
