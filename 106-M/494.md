# `mintBounty` should check managers are initialized

## Summary

`OpenQV1.mintBounty` calls `bountyFactory.mintBounty` with `claimManager` and `depositManager` variables. But it doesn't check if these managers are initialized.

## Vulnerability Detail

`OpenQV1.mintBounty` calls `bountyFactory.mintBounty`:

```solidity
        address bountyAddress = bountyFactory.mintBounty(
            _bountyId,
            msg.sender,
            _organization,
            claimManager,
            depositManager,
            _initOperation
        );
```

But the function doesn't check if these managers are initialized. The created bounty contract may be unable to claim if it sets a claimManager of address(0). 

## Impact

The bounty will be unable to claim if the `OpenQV1` owner doesn't initialize manager addresses or temporarily disable the `claimManager`.

## Recommendation

Check `claimManager != address(0)` and `depositManager != address(0)` in `mintBounty`.
