# volume sent when depositing protocol token is not aligned with msg.value

## Summary

Let say I would like to deposit some protocol tokens. From the signature of `fundBountyToken` we can expect that, as users of the contract, we must set the volume variable to the same value as msg.value, or less and get a refund of the difference. But this is actually not the case, `_volume` is only used by erc-20 tokens but does not apply to protocol token. However, _volume cannot be 0 when only protocol token is sent.

The contract interface is not clear. I would rather either leverage the volume variable in case of protocol token deposit by reimbursing any excess of msg.value or at least always require the user to set it to 0 but currently the value can only be anything but 0 which does not make sense to me as a user of the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
function receiveFunds(
        address _funder,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _volume,
        uint256 _expiration
    )
        external
        payable
        virtual
        onlyDepositManager
        nonReentrant
        returns (bytes32, uint256)
    {
        require(_volume != 0, Errors.ZERO_VOLUME_SENT); <====================================== must not be 0 but the _volume is not checked when receiving protocol tokens...
        require(_expiration > 0, Errors.EXPIRATION_NOT_GREATER_THAN_ZERO);
        require(status == OpenQDefinitions.OPEN, Errors.CONTRACT_IS_CLOSED);

        bytes32 depositId = _generateDepositId();

        uint256 volumeReceived;
        if (_tokenAddress == address(0)) {
            volumeReceived = msg.value; <================================================= _volume is not checked
        } else {
            volumeReceived = _receiveERC20(_tokenAddress, _funder, _volume);
        }

        funder[depositId] = _funder;
        tokenAddress[depositId] = _tokenAddress;
        volume[depositId] = volumeReceived;
        depositTime[depositId] = block.timestamp;
        expiration[depositId] = _expiration;
        isNFT[depositId] = false;

        deposits.push(depositId);
        tokenAddresses.add(_tokenAddress);

        return (depositId, volumeReceived);
    }
```

## Impact

Unhappy users who might have misused the interface of the contract because it's not clear enough.

## Recommendation

Leverage the volume variable by reimbursing any excess of msg.value or at least require the user to always set the volume to 0 when sending protocol token. You might even split the function into two dedicated functions with explicit names (ERC20 vs ProtocolToken) for even higher clarity.
