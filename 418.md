# BountyCore's receiveFunds method doesn't check if ERC20 and ETH are being deposit together, possibly leading to loss of funds.

## Summary
Depositors who send ETH and ERC20 tokens in the same call to `fundBountyToken`, won't be able to refund the ETH sent, and on specific circumstances, this ETH would be permanently locked inside the bounty contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
`BountyCore`'s `receiveFunds` does not check if `msg.value == 0` when `_tokenAddress != 0`. If a depositor funds some ERC20 token but also sends some ETH on the same call to `fundBountyToken`, it would go through, but only the ERC20 amount would be registered as a deposit, therefore the depositor won't be able to refund those ETH sent. If there are no other ETH deposits, `tokenAddresses` would also not get updated with `address(0)`, leading to this funds being permanently locked inside the bounty contract, as they would not be transferred when calling `refundDeposit` or `claimBounty`.

## Impact
All types of bounties are affected by this, because they all use the same `receiveFunds` implementation from `BountyCore`. On the circumstances detailed above, ETH deposit wouldn't be able to be refunded, nor claimed. Therefore would get permanently locked inside the bounty contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review.

## Recommendation
Consider adding a check for `msg.value == 0` when `_tokenAddress != 0` in `BountyCore`'s `receiveFunds`, as shown in the diff below.
