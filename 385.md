# When token is not native, msg.value should be 0

## Summary
Funding of ERC20 tokens should validate that native value is not attached along.

## Vulnerability Detail

When `_tokenAddress`  is empty, the volume is taken from `msg.value`:

```solidity
   if (_tokenAddress == address(0)) {
     volumeReceived = msg.value;
   } else {
     volumeReceived = _receiveERC20(_tokenAddress, _funder, _volume);
   }
```
However, it does not check that `msg.value` is 0 if the token is ERC20, thus technically it is possible to send value alongside other tokens.

## Impact

If any native token is accidentally attached when funding the bounty with the non-native token, it will be considered lost.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Require `msg.value` is 0 when the token is not `address(0)`.
