# DOS bounty funding

## Summary
Each bounty is only allowed to have `openQTokenWhitelist.TOKEN_ADDRESS_LIMIT()` number of tokens. Attacker can frontrun the bounty owner funding request in a way which DOS bounty owner funding request

## Vulnerability Detail
1. A bounty was created at address `A`
2. Lets say for simplicity `openQTokenWhitelist.TOKEN_ADDRESS_LIMIT()` is set to 1
3. Ideally only one token should be allowed for funding
4. Bounty owner tries funding token X 
5. Attacker immediately frontrun this request and instead fund a malicious token X. Since TOKEN_ADDRESS_LIMIT is not reached funding is accepted

```solidity
if (!isWhitelisted(_tokenAddress)) {
            require(
                !tokenAddressLimitReached(_bountyAddress),
                Errors.TOO_MANY_TOKEN_ADDRESSES
            );
        }
```
7. Bounty owner funding from Step 4 is reverted since limit is already reached
8. Bounty owner can have the limit increased but Attacker can again frontrun, making sure that bounty owner is never fund the bounty

## Impact
Attacker can DOS bounty owner from funding

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Funding should only be allowed for Whitelisted token. If user is trying to fund non whitelisted token then owner should first whitelist that token
