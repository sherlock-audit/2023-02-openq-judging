# When the ClaimManagerV1# `claimBounty()` is called for a payout of the claimant for the AtomicBountyV1, that transaction will fail because of shortfall of the `available fund` of the payout token address in the AtomicBounty contract.

## Summary
When the ClaimManagerV1# `claimBounty()` is called for a payout of the claimant for the AtomicBountyV1, that transaction will fail because of shortfall of the `available fund` of the payout token address in the AtomicBounty contract that is caused by the lack of a validation to check whether or not the `available fund` of the payout token address in the AtomicBounty contract is greater than the `claimedBalance` calculated within the AtomicBountyV1# `claimBalance()`.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a payout of a claimant for the AtomicBountyV1, the ClaimManagerV1# `claimBounty()` is called and then the ClaimManagerV1# `_claimAtomicBounty()` is called within the ClaimManagerV1# `claimBounty()` like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/ClaimManager/Implementations/ClaimManagerV1.sol#L43
```solidity
    function claimBounty(
        address _bountyAddress,
        address _closer,
        bytes calldata _closerData
    ) external onlyOracle onlyProxy {
        IBounty bounty = IBounty(payable(_bountyAddress));
        uint256 _bountyType = bounty.bountyType();

        if (_bountyType == OpenQDefinitions.ATOMIC) {
            // Decode to ensure data meets closerData schema before emitting any events
            abi.decode(_closerData, (address, string, address, string));

            _claimAtomicBounty(bounty, _closer, _closerData);  /// @audit 
...
```

Then, within the ClaimManagerV1# `_claimAtomicBounty()`, 
the AtomicBountyV1# `claimBalance()` is called like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/ClaimManager/Implementations/ClaimManagerV1.sol#L131-L134
```solidity
    function _claimAtomicBounty(
        IAtomicBounty _bounty,
        address _closer,
        bytes calldata _closerData
    ) internal {
        _eligibleToClaimAtomicBounty(_bounty, _closer);

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _bounty.getTokenAddresses().length; i++) {
            uint256 volume = _bounty.claimBalance(  /// @audit 
                _closer,
                _bounty.getTokenAddresses()[i]
            );
...
```

Then, within the AtomicBountyV1# `claimBalance()`, 
the `claimedBalance` of the payout token address is calculated and it would be transferred via the BountyCore# `_transferToken()` like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/AtomicBountyV1.sol#L95-L96
```solidity
    function claimBalance(address _payoutAddress, address _tokenAddress)
        external
        onlyClaimManager
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256)
    {
        uint256 claimedBalance = getTokenBalance(_tokenAddress);
        _transferToken(_tokenAddress, claimedBalance, _payoutAddress);  /// @audit 
        return claimedBalance;
    }
```

Within the BountyCore# `_transferToken()`, the payout amount is transferred into the claimant depends on the payout token address like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L186-L190
```solidity
    function _transferToken(
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _volume,
        address _payoutAddress
    ) internal virtual {
        if (_tokenAddress == address(0)) {
            _transferProtocolToken(_payoutAddress, _volume);
        } else {
            _transferERC20(_tokenAddress, _payoutAddress, _volume);
        }
    }
```

On the assumption that, the AtomicBountyV1 is defined as a bounty type that is fixed-price, single contributor contracts.
Thus, when the ClaimManagerV1# `claimBounty()` is called for a payout of the claimant for the AtomicBountyV1, the `available fund` of the payout token address in the AtomicBounty contract must be greater than the `claimedBalance` calculated within the AtomicBountyV1# `claimBalance()`.

However, there is no validation to check whether or not the `available fund` of the payout token address in the AtomicBounty contract is greater than the `claimedBalance` calculated within the AtomicBountyV1# `claimBalance()`.

## Impact
This lead to a bad situation that when the ClaimManagerV1# `claimBounty()` is called for a payout of the claimant for the AtomicBountyV1, that transaction will fail because of shortfall of the `available fund` of the payout token address in the AtomicBounty contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a calculation and a validation to the AtomicBountyV1# `claimBalance()` like this:
```solidity
    function claimBalance(address _payoutAddress, address _tokenAddress)
        external
        onlyClaimManager
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256)
    {
        uint256 claimedBalance = getTokenBalance(_tokenAddress);
        
        /// @audit - Adding the calculation in order to calculate the availableFunds like this:
        uint256 availableFunds;
        if (_tokenAddress == address(0)) {
            availableFunds = payable(address(this)).balance;
        } else {
            availableFunds = IERC20( _tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        }
        
        /// @audit - Adding the condition in order to check whether or not the `available fund` of the payout token address in the AtomicBounty contract is greater than the `claimedBalance` like this:
        uint256 availableFunds;
        require(availableFunds >= claimedBalance, "availableFunds must be greater than claimedBalance");
 
        _transferToken(_tokenAddress, claimedBalance, _payoutAddress);
        return claimedBalance;
    }
```
