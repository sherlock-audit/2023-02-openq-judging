# Block All Refunds By Overflowing Expiry Time

## Summary
The expiration of a deposit has no upper bounds and what timestamp it creates when added to deposit time is never checked when initially creating the deposit.

This means that a malicious actor can create a deposit with a type(uint256).max expiration.

What this then does is, when checking for locked funds, the contract adds that expiration to the deposit time, resulting in an overflow. This means that every time a refund is requested the contract will revert, and it will be impossible to get a refund.

This will lead to a lot of funds stuck in the bounty, especially if combined with a claim DoS.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Create a 1 token wei deposit with type(uint256).max expiration.
2. The contract now will revert on any attempt at a refund.

## Impact
High--all refunds are permanently blocked.

## Code Snippet
The overflow will occur on this line: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L344
