# Malicious users can pretend to be other organizations

## Summary

In `OpenQV1.mintBounty`, users can choose `_bountyId` and `_organization` they want. And in the comments of `BountyFactory`. It says that `_organization` is a UUID representing the bounty's off-chain source. Thus, a malicious user can use another's organization ID to create a bounty and trick other users.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `OpenQV1.mintBounty`, users can choose `_bountyId` and `_organization` they want.

```solidity
    function mintBounty(
        string calldata _bountyId,
        string calldata _organization,
        OpenQDefinitions.InitOperation memory _initOperation
    ) external nonReentrant onlyProxy returns (address) {
        require(
            bountyIdToAddress[_bountyId] == address(0),
            Errors.BOUNTY_ALREADY_EXISTS
        );

        address bountyAddress = bountyFactory.mintBounty(
            _bountyId,
            msg.sender,
            _organization,
            claimManager,
            depositManager,
            _initOperation
        );

        …
    }
```

The comment says that `_organization` is a UUID representing the bounty's off-chain source

## Impact

Malicious users can pretend to be other organizations. It could lead to phishing, social engineering and discrediting other organizations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use oracle to build a mapping between organizations and addresses like `OpenQV1.associateExternalIdToAddress` did. And check the mapping in `OpenQV1.mintBounty`.
