# Deposit refund and claim bounty transaction revert if the recipient of the fund is a contract that does not support ETH transfer or NFT transfer

## Summary

Deposit refund and claim bounty transaction revert if the recipient of the fund is a contract that does not support ETH transfer or NFT transfer

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation, a user can fund the contract via DepositManager.sol using matic token (MATIC), or ERC20 or NFT.

A user can reclaim / get the token refund via [[DepositManager.so](http://depositmanager.so/)](http://DepositManager.so)l after the expiration.

The developer can claim the bounty if the form of ERC20 token, or native MATIC or NFT.

Deposit refund and claim bounty transaction revert if the recipient of the fund is a contract that does not support ETH transfer or NFT transfer

For example, when a bounty refund is called:

```solidity
bounty.refundDeposit(_depositId, msg.sender, volume);
```

which calls:

```solidity
function refundDeposit(
      bytes32 _depositId,
      address _funder,
      uint256 _volume
  ) external virtual onlyDepositManager nonReentrant {
      require(!refunded[_depositId], Errors.DEPOSIT_ALREADY_REFUNDED);
      require(funder[_depositId] == _funder, Errors.CALLER_NOT_FUNDER);
      require(
          block.timestamp >= depositTime[_depositId] + expiration[_depositId],
          Errors.PREMATURE_REFUND_REQUEST
      );

      refunded[_depositId] = true;

      if (tokenAddress[_depositId] == address(0)) {
          _transferProtocolToken(funder[_depositId], _volume);
      } else if (isNFT[_depositId]) {
          _transferNft(
              tokenAddress[_depositId],
              funder[_depositId],
              tokenId[_depositId]
          );
      } else {
          _transferERC20(
              tokenAddress[_depositId],
              funder[_depositId],
              _volume
          );
      }
  }
```

When refunding native token, which calls: _transferProtocolToken(funder[_depositId], _volume);

if the recipient funder address is smart contract that does not implement the fallback receive function to receive ETH, transaction revert.

if the recipient funder address is smart contract that does not implement the onERC721Received interface to support NFT transfer, transaction revert in the code below:

```solidity
_transferNft(
    tokenAddress[_depositId],
    funder[_depositId],
    tokenId[_depositId]
);
```

beause the nft transfer use safeTransferFrom:

```solidity
/// @notice Transfers NFT of _tokenId on _tokenAddress from bounty address to _payoutAddress
/// @param _tokenAddress The ERC721 token address
/// @param _payoutAddress The sender of the NFT
/// @param _tokenId The tokenId
function _transferNft(
    address _tokenAddress,
    address _payoutAddress,
    uint256 _tokenId
) internal virtual {
    IERC721Upgradeable nft = IERC721Upgradeable(_tokenAddress);
    nft.safeTransferFrom(address(this), _payoutAddress, _tokenId);
}
```

- Safely transfers the ownership of a given token ID to another address If the target address is a contract, it must implement `[IERC721Receiver.onERC721Received](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received-address-address-uint256-bytes-)`
, which is called upon a safe transfer, and return the magic value `bytes4(keccak256("onERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes)"))`
; otherwise, the transfer is reverted. Requires the msg.sender to be the owner, approved, or operator

The same issue happens when claiming the bounty:

According to the protocol team

[https://discord.com/channels/812037309376495636/1070357876058620034/1074013519986561105](https://discord.com/channels/812037309376495636/1070357876058620034/1074013519986561105)

The bounty recipient’s address can be a smart contract address.

1. it passes thru the oracle. the logic for this claimBounty method runs on our oracle, and it checks that the caller has a signed Github OAuth token representing the person who wrote a certain merged pull request
2. ***February 11, 2023 12:06 PM*February 11, 2023 12:06 PM*February 11, 2023 12:06 PM***
    
    and they can pass along any address (note that this address could even be a contract address)
    

```solidity
function claimBounty(
    address _bountyAddress,
    address _closer,
    bytes calldata _closerData
) external onlyOracle onlyProxy {
```

and

```solidity
function permissionedClaimTieredBounty(
    address _bountyAddress,
    bytes calldata _closerData
) external onlyProxy
```

If the recipient address is a smart contract does not support ETH transfer or does not implement onERC721Received, transactoin claim revert.

The issue that the developer may not aware that he needs to set a smart contract that can receive ETH or support NFT transfer, changing the recipient address maybe very difficult, for example, once all the document is bonded to a address and the KYC soulbond NFT (that cannot be transferred) is minted to a address

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol check that the recipient address is only an EOA address or check that the recipient support ERC721 transfer by checking that the recipient support onERC721Received interface and ETH transfer. If the smart contract does not support ETH transfer, the protocol can wrap the native MATIC to WMATIC and send the WMATIC out.
