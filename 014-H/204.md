# Anyone can deposit tokens outside of the whitelist into the bounty, which may result in the winner not be able to claim the prize

## Summary
DepositManagerV1.fundBountyToken allows anyone to deposit tokens outside the whitelist into the bounty, if a malicious user deposits tokens under his control, ClaimManagerV1._claimAtomicBounty/_ claimTieredPercentageBounty will revert in the loop, thus preventing the winner from claiming his prize.
## Vulnerability Detail
Anyone can call DepositManagerV1.fundBountyToken to deposit tokens into the bounty, when the tokens are not in the whitelist, they can pass the check as long as the number of tokens does not exceed the limit
```solidity
    function fundBountyToken(
        address _bountyAddress,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _volume,
        uint256 _expiration,
        string memory funderUuid
    ) external payable onlyProxy {
        IBounty bounty = IBounty(payable(_bountyAddress));

        if (!isWhitelisted(_tokenAddress)) {
            require(
                !tokenAddressLimitReached(_bountyAddress),
                Errors.TOO_MANY_TOKEN_ADDRESSES
            );
        }
```
A malicious user can deposit a token that he can pause to transfer at any time into the bounty.
Since ClaimManagerV1._claimAtomicBounty/_claimTieredPercentageBounty will transfer all deposited tokens in the contract in the loop, if the malicious user pauses the transfer of his deposited tokens, then ClaimManagerV1._claimAtomicBounty/_claimTieredPercentageBounty will revert in the loop, resulting in the winner not being able to claim his prize.
```solidity
    function _claimAtomicBounty(
        IAtomicBounty _bounty,
        address _closer,
        bytes calldata _closerData
    ) internal {
        _eligibleToClaimAtomicBounty(_bounty, _closer);

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _bounty.getTokenAddresses().length; i++) {
            uint256 volume = _bounty.claimBalance(
                _closer,
                _bounty.getTokenAddresses()[i]
            );
...
    function _claimTieredPercentageBounty(
        IBounty _bounty,
        address _closer,
        bytes calldata _closerData
    ) internal {
        ...
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _bounty.getTokenAddresses().length; i++) {
            uint256 volume = _bounty.claimTiered(
                _closer,
                _tier,
                _bounty.getTokenAddresses()[i]
            );
```
