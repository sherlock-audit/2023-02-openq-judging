# Malicious token can block tiered percentage bounty close

## Summary
It might be impossible to close the tiered percentage bounty if any token balance calculation fails.

## Vulnerability Detail
When closing the tiered percentage bounty competition it iterates over all the tokens and gets their respective balances:
```solidity
    function closeCompetition() external onlyClaimManager {
        require(
            status == OpenQDefinitions.OPEN,
            Errors.CONTRACT_ALREADY_CLOSED
        );

        status = OpenQDefinitions.CLOSED;
        bountyClosedTime = block.timestamp;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < getTokenAddresses().length; i++) {
            address _tokenAddress = getTokenAddresses()[i];
            fundingTotals[_tokenAddress] = getTokenBalance(_tokenAddress);
        }
    }
```
The problem is that ```token.balanceOf``` might revert if a malicious token was inserted among other funds. This is highly possible because any token can be used unless the limit is reached:
```solidity
    function fundBountyToken(
        address _bountyAddress,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _volume,
        uint256 _expiration,
        string memory funderUuid
    ) external payable onlyProxy {
        IBounty bounty = IBounty(payable(_bountyAddress));

        if (!isWhitelisted(_tokenAddress)) {
            require(
                !tokenAddressLimitReached(_bountyAddress),
                Errors.TOO_MANY_TOKEN_ADDRESSES
            );
        }
```

## Impact
If a malicious token that reverts on a certain `balanceOf` call, is inserted in the tiered percentage bounty funds, it will be impossible to close this bounty.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There are many possibilities. For example, you can try/catch and set the balance to 0 if it reverts, or get the balance only when claiming and allow specifying which tokens to claim.
