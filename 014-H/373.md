# DOS attack with customized ERC20 token

## Summary
DOS attack is possible through some of the bounty patterns(atomic bounty, tiered percentage bounty) if someone funds with a customized ERC20 token. 


## Vulnerability Detail
Because the protocol is permissionless and anyone can fund the bounty pattern(atomic bounty, tiered percentage bounty)  with any ERC20 token, when someone fund the bounty with a customized ERC20 token which cost huge amount of gas the following process in the loop will fail to be run. It causes the bounty's funds not claimable for anyone. 



## Impact
Denial of the protocol's service. Malicious token deposited can make winner unable to claim the bounty. 

## Code Snippet
The attack can happen in this "for loop":

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There are several ways to avoid this attack. 
- Do not allow unwhitelisted tokens to be used in the protocol. 
  - Change the related code into this: (related code: [DepositManagerV1.sol#L45-L50](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L36-L74))

```solidity
if (!isWhitelisted(_tokenAddress)) { 
  revert("Token isn't whitelisted");
 } 
```
- Avoid using loop to claim all of the tokens in one transaction. Create a function to allow the claiming of only one kind of token per transaction. 
- You can also leave the loop to claim the function but at the same time, add a new emergent function to allow single token claiming.
