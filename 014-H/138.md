# Claimer gets malicious tokens

## Summary
Attacker can fund malicious tokens for `TieredPercentageBounty` bounty. When victim makes claim on this bounty then alongwith genuine tokens (funded by funder), the malicious token will also get distributed

## Vulnerability Detail
1. A new `TieredPercentageBounty` bounty is created
2. Victim has funded say 2 tokens
3. The token limit is not reached and Attacker funds a malicious token X which adds this token to `tokenAddresses`

```solidity
tokenAddresses.add(_tokenAddress);
```

5. Victim claims the bounty which calls `_claimTieredPercentageBounty`

```solidity
 for (uint256 i = 0; i < _bounty.getTokenAddresses().length; i++) {
            uint256 volume = _bounty.claimTiered(
                _closer,
                _tier,
                _bounty.getTokenAddresses()[i]
            );
```

6. As we can see this is going through all token address which means the malicious token added by Attacker will also get distributed

## Impact
Victim might trust these malicious token as these are coming from openQ contract. This may lead to insecure interaction with these tokens, which might lead to loss of funds

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Only funder should be allowed to fund bounty. In cases where third party is absolutely required then funding should only be allowed on whitelisted token
