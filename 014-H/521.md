# Claiming of rewards can be indefinitely blocked by a malicious ERC20 token

## Summary
Claiming bounties from some bounty contracts (`AtomicBountyV1` and `TieredPercentageBountyV1`) can be blocked indefinitely by a malicious actor who have deposited a malicious ERC20 token. Bounty winners will not be able to receive their rewards from the contracts.
## Vulnerability Detail
The [DepositManagerV1.fundBountyToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L36) function allows any user to deposit funds int oa bounty contract. When bounty winners claim rewards from the `AtomicBountyV1` and `TieredPercentageBountyV1` contracts, rewards are paid in whatever tokens were deposited to the contracts:
1. when claiming from `AtomicBountyV1`, the [addresses of deposited tokens are iterated and full balance of each of them is claimed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/ClaimManager/Implementations/ClaimManagerV1.sol#L130-L134);
1. when [claiming](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/ClaimManager/Implementations/ClaimManagerV1.sol#L203) from `TieredPercentageBountyV1`, in the [closeCompetition](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/TieredPercentageBountyV1.sol#L123) call, the addresses of all deposited tokens are iterated and `balanceOf` is [called on each of them](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L298).

However, any of the token addresses can be a malicious contract that reverts in the `transfer` and `balanceOf` calls, resulting in a reverted claim. Consider this example exploit scenario:
1. A malicious actor creates a malicious ERC20 contract that reverts in `transfer` and `balanceOf` calls conditionally (e.g. when the function is called by a bounty contract during a claim).
1. The malicious actor deposits the malicious ERC20 tokens in to a `AtomicBountyV1` or `TieredPercentageBountyV1` contract.
1. When a bounty winner claims their reward from the bounty contract, the subsequent `transfer` or `balanceOf` call to the malicious ERC20 token reverts.
1. The bounty winner cannot claim the reward due to the malicious ERC20 token contract reverting the call.
## Impact
Bounty winners cannot claim their rewards from `AtomicBountyV1` and `TieredPercentageBountyV1` bounty contracts.

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Consider either of these:
1. disallowing anyone to deposit funds into bounty contracts, to prevent malicious actors from depositing malicious ERC20 tokens;
1. disallowing depositing of non-whitelisted tokens, to prevent depositing of malicious ERC20 tokens;
1. skipping (via [try/catch](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/control-structures.html#try-catch)) failed calls to ERC20 tokens during claiming, to skip failed token transfers during claiming.
