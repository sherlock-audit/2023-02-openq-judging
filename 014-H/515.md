# funding of bounties with erc20 tokens can be blocked

## Summary
The protocol has whitelisting  capabilities. 
In case of funding a bounty with NFT tokens the whitelisting is respected.

But in case when funding bounties with ERC20 tokens the whitelisting is not stopping anyone from funding the bounty with "malicious" token address.

The problem is not the malicious token itself but that a bounty can have only a specified (in our deploy case 5) token address specified. 

If a malicious user scans the mempool for `BountyFactory#mintBounty` calls as a adversary he can create so many founding that will reach the imposed limited.

Note : The offender can supply funding with just the gas cost. Because address can be ERC20 like contracts with no real value.

When the legit founding (`fundBountyToken`) comes around it will be reverted with `TOO_MANY_TOKEN_ADDRESSES` revert reason.

## Vulnerability Detail
Bounty can have its functionality of ERC20 funding blocked if malicious user first supplies/funds with "fake ERC20" token addresses.

## Impact
In the deploy script we can see that currently the limit per bounty is set to 5 different token addresses.

When a legit users with a legit token address calls `fundBountyToken` method and the malicious user has already supplied enough token addresses its transaction will be reverted

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of allowing whitelisting of ERC20 tokens to pass trough. Do it like is done for the NFT funding:

```solidity
require(isWhitelisted(_tokenAddress), Errors.TOKEN_NOT_ACCEPTED);
```
