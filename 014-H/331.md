# A Malicious ERC20 Can Permanently DoS Claims

## Summary
Because any ERC20 is allowed to be added to the token list and claims operate in a push rather than pull scheme, a malicious ERC20 can be added that will revert on transfer. When the competition closes and claims are to happen, the loop that sends all tokens to the winner will revert every time and never be able to be close.

This can also be done with calls in other places, such as calling to check the balance of the token on the contract, which can cause problems elsewhere.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Create an ERC20 where tokens can only be transferred from your address.
2. Fund a bounty with that ERC20. It's added to the token addresses list.
3. When the bounty concludes, no claim payouts will be able to be made because your ERC20 will revert.

## Impact
High. This will permanently freeze all claims and permanently freeze everything if refunds are blocked as well.

## Code Snippet
Line of code where every token included is looped over and transferred https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/ClaimManager/Implementations/ClaimManagerV1.sol#L130

Line of code where the whitelist doesn't block malicious ERC20s https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L45

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
My recommendation would be to either disallow all non-whitelisted ERC20s, to make all bounties a pull scheme, or to do a low level transfer call that won't revert on failure.
