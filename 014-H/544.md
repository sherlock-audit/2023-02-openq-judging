# Blacklisted user may prevent certain bounty claims

## Summary

Blacklisted user may prevent certain bounty claims

## Vulnerability Detail

If a user becomes blacklisted for the token being claimed e.g is added to the USDC blacklist and the USDC token is being claimed, they would prevent bounty claims from happening.

For example: In `_claimTieredPercentageBounty` there is a loop used in claiming:

```solidity
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _bounty.getTokenAddresses().length; i++) {
            uint256 volume = _bounty.claimTiered(
                _closer,
                _tier,
                _bounty.getTokenAddresses()[i]
            );
```

This would revert whenever a transfer is attempted to a blacklisted user.

## Impact

Denial of service in certain claim functions.
