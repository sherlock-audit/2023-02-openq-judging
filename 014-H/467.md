# Funder may not be able to refund their deposit

## Summary

A funder may be unable to refund their deposits from a bounty contract if they are blocked in some way from receiving transfers of that token (Example: USDC blacklist).

## Vulnerability Detail

The ```refundDeposit``` function in ```BountyCore.sol``` allows the funder of a deposit to refund their deposit and reclaim tokens sent to a bounty contract if the deposit has expired and the bounty has not been claimed. If the tokens to be claimed are ERC20 tokens then the ```refundDeposit``` function calls the [```_transferERC20```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L221-L228) function which will transfer the tokens to the funder of the deposit. If, for example, USDC is used and the funder becomes blacklisted so that they cannot transfer or receive USDC after they have deposited the funds to the bounty then the ```refundDeposit``` function will revert and the funder is unable to refund and retrieve their tokens.

## Impact

A blacklisted funder may be unable to refund their deposit when they are supposed to be able to.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Allow a funder to specify a ```to``` address to which the tokens must be sent when refunding a deposit.
