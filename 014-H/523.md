# Attackers can DOS claims of `USDC` blacklisted claimers

## Summary
An attacker can prevent `USDC` blacklisted claimers from claiming their rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail
`_claimAtomicBounty()` loops through the `tokenAddresses` of the bounty to send tokens to the claimer

```solidity
File: contracts/ClaimManager/Implementations/ClaimManagerV1.sol
130:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < _bounty.getTokenAddresses().length; i++) {
131:             uint256 volume = _bounty.claimBalance(
132:                 _closer,
133:                 _bounty.getTokenAddresses()[i]
134:             );
```

The issue is that if the claimer is blacklisted by `USDC`, an attacker can simply add `1 wei` of `USDC` to the bounty contract by calling `fundBountyToken()` to revert `bounty.claimBalance(amount, USDC)`, adding `USDC` to `tokenAddresses` and preventing the claimer from receiving their funds.

## Impact
A claimer cannot retrieve their reward.
The problem is that most bounty issuers will most likely set a bounty in a specific token (for instance native `MATIC`), a USDC blacklisted claimer will then complete the task required, knowing they can receive `MATIC`.
Anyone can DOS their claim with a call to `DepositManager.fundBountyToken()` with a dust volume of USDC.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a `try/catch` method for claiming.
