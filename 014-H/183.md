# Competitors who are in the blacklist can't gain the payout if the rewards contain USDC

## Summary
if rewards contain USDC, some user can get the rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail
In a bounty, the rewards can be comprised by many tokens and USDC can be the one in that list. USDC has a special mechanism which will revert every transfer transactions which contain a blacklist address. 

In AtomicBounty, when paying the reward for closer, the bounty needs to loop through the entire `tokenAddress[]` array. So if there is a failed transfer in a iteration, the entire process will revert. 
```solidity=
// contract: ClaimManagerV1.sol 

function _claimAtomicBounty(
    IAtomicBounty _bounty,
    address _closer,
    bytes calldata _closerData
) internal {
    _eligibleToClaimAtomicBounty(_bounty, _closer);

    /// [#explain] claim ERC20  
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _bounty.getTokenAddresses().length; i++) {
        uint256 volume = _bounty.claimBalance(
            _closer,
            _bounty.getTokenAddresses()[i] /// [$audit-med] out-of-gas here  
        );

        /// ...
    }

    /// [#explain] claim ERC721
    /// ... 
}
```
Applying the special case with USDC here, I assume the competitor who fulfill the task is a blacklisted address and the rewards list contains USDC. Then the competitor can't receive neither the USDC nor the other reward tokens. It seem unfair for him/her. We should have a new mechanism to help him/her to claim the other tokens exclude USDC 

## Impact
User can't claim the rewards
