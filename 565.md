# in BountyCore:refundDeposit there is problem in logic of checking in function that checks wrong.

## Summary
the caller check is not correct 
## Vulnerability Detail
it's designed to not allow the caller who is not funded but it's checking wrongly with the address instead of msg sender who is actually funded
## Impact
the bad actors who is actually not should able to call this will able to call and its against of what the project wants and will make problems 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
  function refundDeposit(
        bytes32 _depositId,
        address _funder,
        uint256 _volume
    ) external virtual onlyDepositManager nonReentrant {
        require(!refunded[_depositId], Errors.DEPOSIT_ALREADY_REFUNDED);
        require(funder[_depositId] == _funder, Errors.CALLER_NOT_FUNDER);
        require(
            block.timestamp >= depositTime[_depositId] + expiration[_depositId],
            Errors.PREMATURE_REFUND_REQUEST
        );

        refunded[_depositId] = true;

        if (tokenAddress[_depositId] == address(0)) {
            _transferProtocolToken(funder[_depositId], _volume);
        } else if (isNFT[_depositId]) {
            _transferNft(
                tokenAddress[_depositId],
                funder[_depositId],
                tokenId[_depositId]
            );
        } else {
            _transferERC20(
                tokenAddress[_depositId],
                funder[_depositId],
                _volume
            );
        }
    }
```

consider checking with msg.sender and who actually funded
