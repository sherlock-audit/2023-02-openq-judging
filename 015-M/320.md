# When volume is greater than availableFunds users wont get all funds back

## Summary

User who request a refund can possibly loose funds by not getting full amount back during `refund`.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user request a refund the function will determine what amount of that users deposits are avaible for a refund. After determining how much the user is entitled to it takes one of two paths. the first path is the result of `if(bounty.volume(_depositId) <= availableFunds)` meaning if the amount the user is eligible for is less than or equal to the amount avaible then the user will get thier entire amount owed back. 

The other path occurs if that same check is fasle. Meaning if amount owed is greater than availible funds. What happens in this path is that the amount availible is sent instead of the amount owed. Which would result in the user not getting back a full refund. This can happen in bounties such as Ongoing Bounty or Tiered Bounties when part of the balance is claimed but not all. 

the major issue here is that after the refund is completed the user is not able to call refund again with the same deposit ID. Meaning they no longer have access to the remaining funds that they were owed. 

Here is a scenario:

Alice mints a Ongoing Bounty where each claim rewards 2 eth
Bob Wants to contribute to the bounty and adds 5 eth 
Claimant #1 completes the bounty and claims 2 eth 
Claimant #2 completes the bounty and claims 2 eth
Bob no longer likes the direction of the organization and decides to withdraw his deposit. 
Currently the bounty only has 1 eth so when bob request a refund he only gets back 1 eth. 
`refunded[_depositID]` is set to true. Effectivly stopping bob from calling refund again.
Bob has lost 4 eth. 

## Impact

Loss of funds.
Users will loose funds when attempting to get a refund from a underfunded bounty.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When calling for a refund from a underfunded bounty only amount avaibible should be sent to the caller. And that amount should be deducted from what they are owed. 

Refunded mapping  should only be set to true when the user has been fully refunded.
