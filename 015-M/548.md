# `refundDeposit` has an incorrect `availableFunds` logic, preventing some depositors from getting a refund when they should

## Summary
`refundDeposit` reverts in situations where the refund should be possible

## Vulnerability Detail
`refundDeposit` computes the available amount in a bounty:
```solidity
File:  contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol
171:         uint256 availableFunds = bounty.getTokenBalance(depToken) -
172:             bounty.getLockedFunds(depToken);
```

```solidity
File: contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol
333:     function getLockedFunds(address _depositId)
334:         public
335:         view
336:         virtual
337:         returns (uint256)
338:     {
339:         uint256 lockedFunds;
340:         bytes32[] memory depList = this.getDeposits();
341:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < depList.length; i++) {
342:             if (
343:                 block.timestamp <
344:                 depositTime[depList[i]] + expiration[depList[i]] &&
345:                 tokenAddress[depList[i]] == _depositId
346:             ) {
347:                 lockedFunds += volume[depList[i]];
348:             }
349:         }
350: 
351:         return lockedFunds;
352:     }
```

The issue is that it loops through all the deposits, regardless of what has been claimed. This mismatch leads to situations where a legitimate refund reverts:

Suppose an outgoing bounty, with a payout of 1_000 USDC. The bounty issuer funds it with 20_000 USDC, with a 2 year expiration.
Alice decides to fund this bounty too with 2_000 USDC, with an expiration of 1 month.
Over the course of the next 2 months, 10 developers successfully complete the task, claiming their bounty, leaving 12_000 USDC in the contract.
Alice's deposit expiry date has passed: she tries to call `refundDeposit`, but `availableFunds` reverts with an underflow error: the balance is only 12_000, while the locked funds is computed as 20_000 (the initial deposit made by the issuer). She now has to wait 22 more months to retrieve her funds.

## Impact
Expiry date of a deposit is not respected, leading to frozen funds in some cases such as the one described above.
