# Incorrect logics for ```refundDeposit()``` function inside ```DeposiManagerV1.sol``` contract file

## Summary
Contract logics countering each other and Funder may loss his funds. Well explained in Vulnerability Detail section.  
 
## Vulnerability Detail
At line no 34 when initializing contract says that ```_expiration``` is The duration until the deposit becomes refundable for funder
That means during this  ```depositTime``` to ```_expiration``` time period Funder will able to withdraw his fund any time.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L34

But when Funder change his mind after depositing his fund and try to withdraw his fund via ```refundDeposit()``` before ```expiration``` reached that function get reverted as it has strict check
```solidity
require(
            block.timestamp >=
                bounty.depositTime(_depositId) + bounty.expiration(_depositId),
            Errors.PREMATURE_REFUND_REQUEST
        );
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L163-L167

Another issue here that as ```refundDeposit()``` restricting Funder from withdrawing fund before expiration, let consider if Funder's expiration time reached and he calls refundDeposit() it then calculate Funder's withdraw amount via 
```solidity 
uint256 availableFunds = bounty.getTokenBalance(depToken) - bounty.getLockedFunds(depToken);
``` 
```solidity
uint256 volume;
        if (bounty.volume(_depositId) <= availableFunds) { 
            volume = bounty.volume(_depositId);
        } else {
            volume = availableFunds;
        }

        bounty.refundDeposit(_depositId, msg.sender, volume);
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L171-L172

Let say at that time(When Funder calling refundDeposit()) ```availableFunds``` not that much, ```Let say user has deposited 10000 tokenX, and during mining of transaction their are only 100 in Contract (This may be due to less free token at that time, or someone else Front-runned Funder transaction by targeting him)```

then control goes to 
```solidity
bounty.refundDeposit(_depositId, msg.sender, volume);
``` 
where it set Funder's that particular ```_depositId``` is refunded via 
```solidity 
refunded[_depositId] = true;
``` 
and further refund is not applicable on that particular ```_depositId```.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L76

That means Funder Deposited 1000 tokenX and only get 100 tokenX as refund amount and He will not able to withdraw his fund until expiration time reached where contract saying ```_expiration :: The duration until the deposit becomes refundable```



## Impact
Funder's fund get locked for more time period,
Funder may loose his fund during request for refundDeposit() function due to less available token or may be due to frontrunned by other malicious party.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Should check whether Protocol Organization wants to refund Funder during Expiration time period or after Expiration time period.
Refund during expiration time period i.e  ```_expiration :: The duration until the deposit becomes refundable``` will increase User's faith in Project.
