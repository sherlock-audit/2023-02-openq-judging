# Ongoing Bounty accepts nfts however there is no option to claim an nft, missing functionality

## Summary
Currently Ongoing Bounties have access to the functions inside of bountyCore rightfully so. However not all functions in bounty core should be applicable to onGoing bounty. In particular funding an NFT. There is no way for a user to claim an NFT from an ongoingbounty. Unlike other bounty tyoes the only option is to claim a token. 

this leads to users needlessly locking up thier NFT for extended periods of time with no actual use. At worst this could be a form of false advertising. where a issuer deposits a valuable NFT to attract work knowing that it is not possible for the claimant to actually get the NFT. 

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There should either be a way for a user to claim an NFT from onGoingBounty. Or there needs to be a check that prevents a user from depositing NFTs to onGoing bounties.
