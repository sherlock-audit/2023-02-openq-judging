# `setPayoutSchedule` and `setPayoutScheduleFixed` still callable even when the claiming already start, will messed up the claimer / winners accounting

## Summary

`setPayoutSchedule` (and `setPayoutScheduleFixed`) is still callable even when the claiming already start, will messed up the accounting 

## Vulnerability Detail

For the Tiered Bounty types, (percentage and fixed), the `setPayoutSchedule` function is used to set the `winner` data (fixed amount and percentage).

But the issue here is, this function doesn't check if the Bounty is closed or not. If the bounty is closed but unknowingly the issuer is trying to modify the `winner` data (`payoutSchedule`) it still can. Normally after the `claim` start, the Bounty is closed, then we can't really change the `winner` data.

For example If Alice is winner and already claimed, but then the issuer tried to update/reset the `payoutSchedule` data, there is a possibility after the update, Alice can reclaim again. 

## Impact

`payoutSchedule` or `winner` data might be tampered, and claimer/winner accounting will be messed up.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Prevent a call to `setPayoutSchedule` (and `setPayoutScheduleFixed`) when the claim is started (or when the Bounty is closed), for example:

```solidity
File: OpenQV1.sol
281:     function setPayoutSchedule(
282:         string calldata _bountyId,
283:         uint256[] calldata _payoutSchedule
284:     ) external onlyProxy {
285:         IBounty bounty = getBounty(_bountyId);
286: 

+.           require(bounty.status() == OpenQDefinitions.OPEN, "Bounty is closed");

287:         require(msg.sender == bounty.issuer(), Errors.CALLER_NOT_ISSUER);
288: 
289:         bounty.setPayoutSchedule(_payoutSchedule);
290: 
291:         emit PayoutScheduleSet(
292:             address(bounty),
293:             address(0),
294:             _payoutSchedule,
295:             bounty.bountyType(),
296:             new bytes(0),
297:             VERSION_1
298:         );
299:     }
```
