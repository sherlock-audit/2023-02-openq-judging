# [M] - __Oraclize_init is not initialized in OpenQV1

## Summary
OpenQV1 inherits the Oraclize.sol contract but it does not initialize it. And because of this associateExternalIdToAddress() function will fail since it uses the onlyOracle modiifier.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract OpenQV1 inherits the OpenQStorageV1 which further inherits more contracts including the Oraclize contract.

```solidity
contract OpenQV1 is OpenQStorageV1 {
	// code
}

abstract contract OpenQStorageV1 is
    IOpenQ,
    OwnableUpgradeable,
    UUPSUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable,
    Oraclize
{
	// code
}
```

And in the initialize() function of OpenQV1.sol, the initializer does not call the __Oraclize_init()

```solidity
function initialize() external initializer onlyProxy {
        __Ownable_init();
        __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
        __ReentrancyGuard_init();
    }
```

The impact of this is that associateExternalIdToAddress() can’t be called because the oracle address is still a zero address.

```solidity
function associateExternalIdToAddress(
        string calldata _externalUserId,
        address _associatedAddress
    ) external onlyOracle {
```

Here is a test that demostrates the same

```solidity
describe('Oracle not initialized', () => {
    it("oracle won't be initialized during deployment", async () => {
      expect(await openQProxy.oracle()).to.eq(ethers.constants.AddressZero);
      const exampleGithubId = 'exampleGithubId'
      await expect(openQProxy
        .connect(oracle)
        .associateExternalIdToAddress(exampleGithubId, owner.address)).to.be.revertedWith("Oraclize: caller is not the current OpenQ Oracle");
    })
  })
```

This will be a temporary problem because the owner can call the  transferOracle() function and set it to the correct oracle. Which is also the reason why this error was not discovered in the first place since the devs are calling `transferOracle()` inside the beforeEach block in the test.

However, `__Oraclize_init()` function won’t ever be executed as it is **not** called in the `initialize()` function in OpenQV1.sol and it is recommended to do so while calling the `initialize()` function.

## Impact
associateExternalIdToAddress() will be reverted on every call since the oracle is a zeroAddress. It can only function properly once the owner decides to call the transferOracle() function and sets it to the correct oracle address.

## Tool used
Manual review, Hardhat

## Recommendation
__Oraclize_init() function needs to be called in the initialize() function of the contract with the correct oracle address.
