# Token limit might be artificially reached

## Summary
Anyone can send NFTs and instantly refund leaving no more space for `nftDepositLimit`.

## Vulnerability Detail
It is possible that anyone can grief the bounty by sending the `nftDepositLimit` number of whitelisted NFTs with a minimum expiration (1 second) and instantly withdraw afterward:
```solidity
    function receiveNft(
        address _sender,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _tokenId,
        uint256 _expiration,
        bytes calldata
    ) external onlyDepositManager nonReentrant returns (bytes32) {
        require(
            nftDeposits.length < nftDepositLimit,
            Errors.NFT_DEPOSIT_LIMIT_REACHED
        );
        require(_expiration > 0, Errors.EXPIRATION_NOT_GREATER_THAN_ZERO);
        _receiveNft(_tokenAddress, _sender, _tokenId);
```
Refunds do not reduce the `nftDeposits.length` leaving the `nftDepositLimit` reached even when the funds are no longer in the contract.

A similar issue but less significant is with ERC20 tokens because there the limit is applied only to not whitelisted tokens:
```solidity
        if (!isWhitelisted(_tokenAddress)) {
            require(
                !tokenAddressLimitReached(_bountyAddress),
                Errors.TOO_MANY_TOKEN_ADDRESSES
            );
        }
```

## Impact

Anyone can front-run deposits to reach the `nftDepositLimit` and prevent legitimate tokens from funding the bounty.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Maybe `refundDeposit` could reduce `nftDeposits.length` but then `depositId` collisions might happen. Introducing a minimum expiration value (e.g. 2 weeks) might partially solve the issue.
