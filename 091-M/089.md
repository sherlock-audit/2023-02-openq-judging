# `TieredFixedBounty` accepts any ERC20 token as deposit, but can only pay in the pre-specified token

## Summary
The contract `TieredFixedBounty` accepts all ERC20 tokens as deposits since it inherits `receiveFunds` from the `BountyCore` contract and timelocks them. The `claimManager` however does not have the necessary functionality to distribute different types of tokens, making them useless.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `TieredFixedBounty` contract accepts ERC20 tokens which it cannot distribute. This can misguide users and cause the lock-up of tokens until expiry. 
## Impact
Lock-up of tokens until expiry

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In TieredFixedBounty.sol, override the base `receiveFunds` implementation and check for the token address
```solidity
function receiveFunds(
        address _funder,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _volume,
        uint256 _expiration
    )
        external
        payable
        override
        onlyDepositManager
        nonReentrant
        returns (bytes32, uint256)
    {
    require(_tokenAddress == payoutTokenAddress, "Token not supported");
    super.receiveFunds(...);
```
