# Unbounded loop in `getLockedFunds` could lead to griefing/DOS attack when user try claiming refunds via `refundDeposit`

## Summary

Griefing/DOS attack is possible when a malcious actor makes multiple fake deposits through `fundBountyToken`. As for, each new deposit its generating a new `depositId` which later it appends to the `deposits` for the record. So whenever a legitmate user try claiming his deposit via `refundDeposit`, it could cause excessive gas usage in `getLockedFunds` and transaction reverted due to block gas limit. 

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Consider the attacker make a deposits of 1 wei of token 5000 times(lets say), which increase the deposits count by 5000. 
2. A legitmate user claim for his deposits by calling `refundDeposit` with `_bountyAddress` and `_depositId` as params.

Where it then calculate the `availableFunds` using current tokenBalance and tokenAmount locked into the bounty before sending it to the user. 

```solidity
uint256 availableFunds = bounty.getTokenBalance(depToken) - bounty.getLockedFunds(depToken);
```

3. getLockedFunds will revert due to step 1, as block gas limit reached. 

Hence, user funds got freezed into the contract and also no claim will be refunded in future for new deposits. 

## Impact
freezing of user funds, and no claim on further new deposits.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Currently attacker can deposit with same account address multiple times and for every deposit a new `depositId` is generated to kept that deposit records. 

In *BountyCore.sol* for `receiveFunds`, We can make sure if funder has previously deposit or not, if yes then there is no need to generate new `depositId`, just update it for the previous `depositId`.
