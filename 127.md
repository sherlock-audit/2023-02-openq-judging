# claimTiered() steal bounty

## Summary
in claimTiered()
Winners can steal prize by first depositing funds, amplifying the total prize,get user prize and then refunding the deposit back
## Vulnerability Detail

The user can get his bonus through ClaimManagerV1.permissionedClaimTieredBounty()
When the type of Bounty is TIERED_PERCENTAGE the process is as follows：
1. verify whether legal by _eligibleToClaimTier()
2. If bounty.status() == OPEN, close the bounty
    2.1 Closing will record the current prize amount to fundingTotals ```fundingTotals[_tokenAddress] = getTokenBalance(_tokenAddress)```
3. Execute claimTiered(tier) to get the corresponding prize according to the ranking
4. Execute claimNft() to get the corresponding nft
5. Mark as taken

The presence of the second step can give one of the winner the possibility to steal the prize.

If the user is the first to claim the prize, the user can first execute fundBountyToken() to expand the total prize, enlarge the prize available to he, and then execute refundDeposit() on the next transaction to retrieve his deposit after success

The steps are as follows:
Assume: 
prize = 100 (The deposit has expired)     
alice = 50%      
No one claim bounty now

1.alice call fundBountyToken() to deposit fund 
   volume = 100 expiration = 1 second
2. alice call permissionedClaimTieredBounty()
2.1 ```fundingTotals``` is set to 200, Double the bonus
3. alice gets its own bonus fundingTotals * 50% = 200 * 50% = 100

 Note: (1,2,3) in the same transaction

4. Wait for the above transaction to succeed, alice
 Execute refundDeposit() to return the 100 deposited in the first step     (this step in the next transaction 12 seconds later) 

5. so alice get a total of 100 + 100 = 200   （steal 50）

Step 4 can be successfully refunded for the following reasons.
1. 2.1 step set the expiration = 1 so the next transaction 12 seconds later, has expired, can be retrieved normally
2. the ```availableFunds``` balance is enough to get back: 200 - 100 

There are two problems here.
1. the above assumption that bounty prize deposit is expired
According to the current contract feels very normal, issuer expiration is generally not set too long, generally the end of the event time, in order to the winners and so on the end of the competition to collect, issuer generally will not go to retrieve, expired is very normal
2. this process, there may be other winners also at the same time to claim the prize, the risk exists, but according to the above description, alice will not lose too much, the risk is still worth it  

The main reason why the above operation is low risky is that the _expiration of the deposit can be set very short (the next transaction). If the mandatory _expiration must be > one day, and the expired deposit can only be retrieved after one day, then this will be discovered by other winners and The probability of taking it away is very high, and it is unlikely that someone will do it at this high risk, so it is recommended to limit the expiration time not to be too small
