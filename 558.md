# Array mismatch can happen when setting a new payout schedule

## Summary

Array mismatch can happen when setting a new payout schedule

## Vulnerability Detail

When setting a new payout schedule, the members of the previous array are copied to the new array.

```solidity
function setPayoutScheduleFixed(
        uint256[] calldata _payoutSchedule,
        address _payoutTokenAddress
    ) external onlyOpenQ {
        require(
            bountyType == OpenQDefinitions.TIERED_FIXED,
            Errors.NOT_A_FIXED_TIERED_BOUNTY
        );
        payoutSchedule = _payoutSchedule;
        payoutTokenAddress = _payoutTokenAddress;

        // Resize metadata arrays and copy current members to new array
        // NOTE: If resizing to fewer tiers than previously, the final indexes will be removed
        string[] memory newTierWinners = new string[](payoutSchedule.length);
        bool[] memory newInvoiceComplete = new bool[](payoutSchedule.length);
        bool[] memory newSupportingDocumentsCompleted = new bool[](
            payoutSchedule.length
        );

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tierWinners.length; i++) {
            newTierWinners[i] = tierWinners[i];
        }
        tierWinners = newTierWinners;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < invoiceComplete.length; i++) {
            newInvoiceComplete[i] = invoiceComplete[i];
        }
        invoiceComplete = newInvoiceComplete;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < supportingDocumentsComplete.length; i++) {
            newSupportingDocumentsCompleted[i] = supportingDocumentsComplete[i];
        }
        supportingDocumentsComplete = newSupportingDocumentsCompleted;
    }
```

As there is no check if the length of the new payout schedule array matches the old one, an out of bounds index error can occur when copying from the old array to the new array.

## Impact

Resizing to fewer tiers will fail due to out of bounds index error.

## Recommendation

Check that the length of the new array is equal or greater than the old array.
