# Broken BountyCore::getLockedFunds()

## Summary

In order to compute the locked funds there is a check to account for the expiration of the the deposit and for the token of the given deposit. However the check of the tokenAddress is broken because the address is compared with the depositId instead of the the actual token address of the deposit

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    /// @notice Returns the amount of locked tokens (of a specific token) on a bounty address, only available for claims but not for refunds
    /// @param _depositId The depositId that determines which token is being looked at
    /// @return uint256
    function getLockedFunds(address _depositId)
        public
        view
        virtual
        returns (uint256)
    {
        uint256 lockedFunds;
        bytes32[] memory depList = this.getDeposits();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < depList.length; i++) {
            if (
                block.timestamp <
                depositTime[depList[i]] + expiration[depList[i]] &&
                tokenAddress[depList[i]] == _depositId   <====================================
            ) {
                lockedFunds += volume[depList[i]];
            }
        }

        return lockedFunds;
    }
```

The check should be

```solidity
tokenAddress[depList[i]] == tokenAddress[_depositId]
```

## Impact

Some funds might be refundable while they should be accounted as locked...

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Replace the faulty line with

```solidity
tokenAddress[depList[i]] == tokenAddress[_depositId]
```
