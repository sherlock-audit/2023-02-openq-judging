# A user can maliciously take the advantage of the refundDeposit to claim refund for other user

## Summary

User can may fail to have his / her bounty fund reclaimed if other users claim their portion of refund.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let us see a sequence of transaction below:

User A call DepositManagerV1.sol#fundBountyToken to fund a tier bounty tier 1 100 USDC.

User B call DepositManagerV1.sol#fundBountyToken to fund a tier bounty tier 2 150 USDC as well.

User C is supposed to claim the tier 1 bounty 100 USDC.

User D is supposed to claim the tier 2 bounty 150 USDC.

**The reality is:**

User C the developer claim the tier 1 bounty 100 USDC within the expiration period.

**User D the developer did not claim the tier 2 bounty within the expiration period.**

User A steps in and call the refundDeposit to get 100 USDC back.

There are 50 USDC left in the bouty contract.

Initially 100 USDC + 150 USDC is supplied, then user C the developer claim 100 USDC, User A maliciously call refundDeposit and get 100 USDC back.

User B cannot get his 150 USDC back because there is only 50 USDC left in the bounty contract.

## Impact

A user can maliciously take the advantage of the refundDeposit to claim refund for other user.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The issue is that once the fund is supplied in the bounty pool, the pool do not distingish whose fund the fund belongs to. We recommend the protocol set the required amount of bounty when the bounty pool is deployed and then when the pool deployed, let the bounty issuer fund the bounty pool only once to avoid such issue.
