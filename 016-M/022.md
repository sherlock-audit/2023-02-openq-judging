# When tokenAddresses set has reached TOKEN_ADDRESS_LIMIT, tokens that are contained in the tokenAddresses set cannot be used for funding

## Summary
A bounty can be funded via the `DepositManagerV1.fundBountyToken` function.

When the token that is deposited is not whitelisted, it is checked that the token address limit is not reached:

This means it is checked that the amount of different tokens deposited to the bounty contract does not exceed the limit:

## Vulnerability Detail
Assume that the current amount of token addresses in a bounty contract is 1 below the limit.

So when another token is funded, the limit is reached. This token address is added to the token addresses set:

When another user (think of a crowdfunding scenario) wants to fund the bounty contract with the same token, this is not possible since the limit is reached.

However it should be possible because the token address is already contained in the token addresses set.

## Impact
When the token address limit is reached, a token that is not whitelisted but contained in the tokenAddresses set cannot be deposited.

Depositing the token does not increase the amount of tokens deposited to the bounty contract so it should be possible to deposit it.

A possible issue with this is in a crowdfunding scenario. One deposit for a token might be successful but then the tokenAddresses set has reached the limit so depositing the same token is no longer possible.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `DepositManagerV1` contract should check if the token is already contained in the `tokenAddresses` set. If it is, the deposit should be allowed regardless whether token address limit is reached.
