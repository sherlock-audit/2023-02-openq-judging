# fundBountyToken() cannot fund token that has been added before

## Summary

token address was previously funded, and now adding funds again will not grow the length of tokenAddresses, so it should not be limited by tokenAddressLimit

## Vulnerability Detail
in order to avoid OUT_OF_GAS attacks.
So fundBountyToken() will check that cannot excee the maximum number of token addresses 
The code is as follows:
```solidity
    function fundBountyToken(
        address _bountyAddress,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _volume,
        uint256 _expiration,
        string memory funderUuid
    ) external payable onlyProxy {
        IBounty bounty = IBounty(payable(_bountyAddress));

        if (!isWhitelisted(_tokenAddress)) {  
            require(
                !tokenAddressLimitReached(_bountyAddress),    //@audit <---------check token address amount
                Errors.TOO_MANY_TOKEN_ADDRESSES
            );
        }

    function tokenAddressLimitReached(address _bountyAddress)
        public
        view
        returns (bool)
    {
        IBounty bounty = IBounty(payable(_bountyAddress));

        return
            bounty.getTokenAddressesCount() >=      //@audit <---------the number of current token addresses cannot exceed the limit
            openQTokenWhitelist.TOKEN_ADDRESS_LIMIT();
    }
```

There is a problem: When the maximum number of token addresses has been reached, no more funds can be provided, even for tokens that already exist in ```tokenAddresses```. 
If the token address has already been funded before, the array length will not grow again.
It should be possible to add

For example:
Suppose the maximum limit = 3
Once deposited token A = 100 token B = 100 token C = 100
When the user wants to add 50 tokens to token A
At this point the execution of fundBountyToken() will prompt
```solidity
Errors.TOO_MANY_TOKEN_ADDRESSES
```
So it is recommended that if the token address has been provided before, it is still possible to add new funds

## Impact
can't fund bounty token

        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _volume,
        uint256 _expiration,
        string memory funderUuid
    ) external payable onlyProxy {
        IBounty bounty = IBounty(payable(_bountyAddress));

        if (!isWhitelisted(_tokenAddress)) {   
            require(
+              bounty.containsToken(_tokenAddress) ||          
                !tokenAddressLimitReached(_bountyAddress),
                Errors.TOO_MANY_TOKEN_ADDRESSES
            );
        }
