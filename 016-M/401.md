# Griefing attack is possible by adding too many token addresses

## Summary

By depositing many kinds of worthless ERC20 tokens, the attacker can get in the way of someone who wants to fund the bounty using unwhitelisted tokens they favor. OngoingBountyV1 and TieredFixedBountyV1 may become unusable if this attack occurs when the `payoutToken` is not whitelisted. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Funding can be made by anyone with any ERC20 token. So attacker is able to send a lot of kinds of ERC20s with different contract addresses. 

Please see the code snippet below. 

The `depositManagerV1` contract checks to see if the token is whitelisted when you provide funding tokens. And if not, it checks to see if the length of the token addresses array has reached its maximum limit. If the maximum limit is reached, the token cannot be funded, even if the bounty issuer cannot do it using unwhitelisted tokens. It would be nice if the issuer of the bounty could fund the bounty themselves when they create it, but if they don't have the money on hand, they may fund it later. In the meantime, they may be subject to this harassment.

## Impact

It is possible for any attacker to conduct a griefing attack to deny the funding of anyone else using a unwhitelisted token. Even though the whitelisted token can still work, part of the bountyâ€™s function could be denied by any malicious attacker. 

## Code Snippet

[DepositManagerV1.sol#L45-L50](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L45-L50)

```solidity
        if (!isWhitelisted(_tokenAddress)) {
            require(
                !tokenAddressLimitReached(_bountyAddress),
                Errors.TOO_MANY_TOKEN_ADDRESSES
            );
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The `fudingToken` selected by the bounty issuer, which may not be in the whitelist, should be always available for anyone to fund with. So in the case of `fudingToken`, the function should avoid the condition check of the `require(!tokenAddressLimitReached(_bountyAddress), Errors.TOO_MANY_TOKEN_ADDRESSES)`.

- A mitigation example:

```solidity
        if (!isWhitelisted(_tokenAddress) && bounty.fundingToken() != _tokenAddress) {
            require(
                !tokenAddressLimitReached(_bountyAddress),
                Errors.TOO_MANY_TOKEN_ADDRESSES
            );
        }

```
