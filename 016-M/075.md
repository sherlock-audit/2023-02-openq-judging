# Attacker can DOS bounty by funding it with worthless ERC20 tokens

## Summary
Bounties can only be funded with a set number of non-whitelisted ERC20 tokens. By adding worthless ERC20 tokens an attacker can stop the bounty issuer from adding their own deposit.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `DepositManagerV1.fundBountyToken()` the contract limits the number of non-whitelisted ERC20 token deposits. By adding worthless ERC20 tokens an attacker can stop the bounty issuer from adding their own deposit. This will only work for bounties funded with non-whitelisted ERC20 tokens, e.g. the project's own token.

## Impact
Bounty issuer won't be able to fund their bounty.

## Code Snippet
[`DepositManagerV1.fundBountyToken()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L45)
```sol
    function fundBountyToken(
        address _bountyAddress,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _volume,
        uint256 _expiration,
        string memory funderUuid
    ) external payable onlyProxy {
        IBounty bounty = IBounty(payable(_bountyAddress));

        if (!isWhitelisted(_tokenAddress)) {
            require(
                !tokenAddressLimitReached(_bountyAddress),
                Errors.TOO_MANY_TOKEN_ADDRESSES
            );
        }
       // ...
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Using a bounty-specific whitelist would allow the issuer to specify the tokens they accept.
