# All non-whitelisted fundings are blocked if token limit is reached (even if token is already in the list)

## Summary
All bounty types allow a limited number of non-whitelisted tokens to be added as funding as a mechanism to prevent stuffing the array and provoking out-of-gas griefing. Unfortunately when the limit of non-whitelisted tokens is reached, no new funding with non-whitelisted tokens can be issued, even if the non-whitelisted token is already in the list of funded tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
We see it here:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L45-L50

there is no check that the non-whitelisted token isn't already in the list of payment tokens

Please note that this is different from issue #6, since it blocks additional funding in any non-whitelisted token after the limit has been reached, whereas it should be allowed to receive funding with a token which is already in the set (since it does not increase the set of funding tokens for the bounty and no out-of-gas griefing is possible).

## Impact
A possibility of grieving attack where a user funds with dust of various tokens up until the limit, disabling the possibility of funding with non-whitelisted tokens completely.

## Recommendation
Check that non-whitelisted token is new to the set of funding tokens before reverting
