# DepositManagerV1.fundBountyNFT doesn't check if address limit is reached

## Summary
DepositManagerV1.fundBountyNFT doesn't check if address limit is reached
## Vulnerability Detail
When user wants to make deposit into bounty through `DepositManagerV1.fundBountyToken`, then `openQTokenWhitelist` is checking if token is [allowed to use](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L45) and also if `openQTokenWhitelist` [has reached limit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L47) of allowed tokens.
In case if more tokens than limit is added into openQTokenWhitelist contract, then all deposits should be disallowed.

But user still can deposit using `DepositManagerV1.fundBountyNFT` function in case if limit is reached, as it checks only [if token is allowed](fundBountyNFT). 
As result that restriction is not working and user is still able to deposit nft into bounty contract.
