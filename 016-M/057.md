# Ability to fund bounty can suffer DOS

## Summary
Attacker can fund a bounty with multiple "fake" tokens and prevent anyone else from funding the bounty.
Valid for all tokens (ERC721, ERC20 and ERC777).

## Vulnerability Detail
For fungible tokens:
If the token whitelist is empty or only partially full the attacker can fund the bounty with multiple worthless tokens until `tokenAddressLimitReached == true`, preventing anyone else from depositing a legitimate token that is not on the whitelist.

For non-fungible tokens:
Every bounty has a hardcoded limit of 5 NFTs.
An attacker can fund the bounty with five worthless NFTs and prevent anyone else from depositing a valuable NFT.
