# TieredBountyCore accepts NFTs even after bounty is closed

## Summary
The contract `TieredBountyCore` handles incoming NFTs for the bounty contract. Incoming ERC20s however are handled by the contract `BountyCore` which it inherits. There is a discrepancy in the check of the status of the bounty between these two functions, which can lead to funding of NFTs even after the contest is over and rewards being claimed, leading to some unfairness of the results.
## Vulnerability Detail
The contract `ClaimManagerV1` handles the claims, and specifically for tiered bounties, it delegates the task to the functions `_claimTieredFixedBounty` or `_claimTieredPercentageBounty`. Both these functions close the bounty competition the first time they are called as can be seen below

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/ClaimManager/Implementations/ClaimManagerV1.sol#L215-L216

The logic behind this is that these bounty contracts will stop processing incoming funds and essentially freeze the balance of the ERC20 tokens in them. This logic is handled in the `receiveFunds` function in `BountyCore`, where the status of the bounty is checked

This check is however missing for the `receiveNft` function defined in `TieredBountyCore`, allowing the bounty to process NFTs even after the contest is over
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/TieredBountyCore.sol#L18-L48

This check is also missing for `receiveNft` functions in other bounty contracts which has this function implemented.

## Impact
Allows the contract to receive Nfts even after bounty status is set to closed, and rewards tier winners with them as well.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check for the status of the bounty contract in the `receiveNft` function similar to what is done for ERC20s,
```solidity
require(status == OpenQDefinitions.OPEN, Errors.CONTRACT_IS_CLOSED);
```
