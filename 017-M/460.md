# Wrong indication of ongoing invoice and supported documents complete

## Summary

Ongoing bounty `setInvoiceComplete` and `setSupportingDocumentsComplete` do not respect the decoded bool value.

## Vulnerability Detail

`setInvoiceComplete` and `setSupportingDocumentsComplete` always push to the respective array, no matter if the boolean flag is true or false:
```solidity
    function setInvoiceComplete(bytes calldata _data) external onlyOpenQ {
        (bytes32 _claimId, bool _invoiceComplete) = abi.decode(
            _data,
            (bytes32, bool)
        );
        invoiceComplete[_claimId] = _invoiceComplete;
        invoiceCompleteClaimIds.push(_claimId);
    }
```
```solidity
    function setSupportingDocumentsComplete(bytes calldata _data)
        external
        onlyOpenQ
    {
        (bytes32 _claimId, bool _supportingDocumentsComplete) = abi.decode(
            _data,
            (bytes32, bool)
        );
        supportingDocumentsComplete[_claimId] = _supportingDocumentsComplete;
        supportingDocumentsCompleteClaimIds.push(_claimId);
    }
```
These arrays are then exposed over getters:
```solidity
    function getSupportingDocumentsComplete()
        external
        view
        returns (bytes memory)
    {
        return abi.encode(supportingDocumentsCompleteClaimIds);
    }
```
```solidity
   function getSupportingDocumentsComplete()
        external
        view
        returns (bytes memory)
    {
        return abi.encode(supportingDocumentsComplete);
    }
```

These results will be included in the getters array no matter if the boolean value was true or false.

## Impact

Functions that rely on these values, can misbehave by treating the data as correct when the actual flag was false.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Only push to the array if the flag is true. If the flag is false, and the entry was present in the array, then should probably remove it.
