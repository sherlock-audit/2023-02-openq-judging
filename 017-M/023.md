# OngoingBountyV1: claimId is pushed to array when invoice complete or documents complete is set to false but it should be removed

## Summary
The `OngoingBountyV1.setInvoiceComplete` and `OngoingBountyV1.setSupportingDocumentsComplete` functions allow to set if the invoice or supporting documents are completed for a `claimId`.

It can be set to `true` or `false`.

However in both cases the `claimId` is pushed to the `supportingDocumentsCompleteClaimIds` or `invoiceCompleteClaimIds` array.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the case that it is set to false. It should not be pushed to the array but instead removed (if it has been pushed before).

The  `supportingDocumentsCompleteClaimIds` and `invoiceCompleteClaimIds` arrays contain the `claimId`s for which supporting documents and invoice are completed.

So obviously when it is set to `false`, the `claimId` should not be contained in the array.

## Impact
`claimId`s are falsely contained in the arrays. This can cause any off-chain components that query the arrays to falsely assume that supporting documents and invoice are completed.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
When `bool` parameter is false, the `claimId` must be removed from the array (in case it was pushed before). In order to implement this behavior, a new array for each function is necessary that contains the index of each `claimId` in the array.
