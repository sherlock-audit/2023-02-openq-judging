# Up to 99 tokens of each type will be left in a tiered percentage bounty contest after all tiers have been claimed

## Summary

Rounding errors cause some tokens to be left in a  a tiered percentage bounty contest after all tiers have been claimed

## Vulnerability Detail

Tier payouts are divided by 100 and rounded down.

Consider the extreme case  where there are 100 tiers, each with 1% of the prize, and there is a total of 99 tokens in the funding pool. Then each tier winner will be awarded 0 tokens, and the 99 tokens will be stuck in the bounty.


## Impact

This will cause some amount of token up to 99 to be stuck in the bounty. If the token has 18 decimal places as is standard, this will be very low impact. If it does not, it can be significant.

One might think this can be worked around by having the issuer call `setPayableSchedule`, assign 100% of funds to a brand-new tier, and then set themselves as the winner of that tier. However, this does not work, as the amount to be claimed is based on `fundingTotals`, which is computed by `closeCompetition`, which can only be called once.

The funds can still be refunded however, unless the separately-reported attack disabling refunds has been carried out. See https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq-jkoppel/issues/3 .

## Code Snippet

Here is the offending code, from `TieredPercentageBountyV1.claimTiered`, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/TieredPercentageBountyV1.sol#L104 .

```solidity
uint256 claimedBalance = (payoutSchedule[_tier] *
            fundingTotals[_tokenAddress]) / 100;
```

The division by 100 rounds down, causing the token loss.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In closeCompetition, precompute the amount of token to be provided to each tier, and ensure they add up to the funding total.
