# DoS on NFT deposit due to deposit limit

## Summary

Since anyone can deposit a NFT and the limit in number of NFT per bounty is set to 5, a malicious user could deposit 5 NFTs in all new bounties created by the factory making the feature completely unusable.

## Vulnerability Detail

Using a limit of the number of tokens to be deposited in a bounty means that if a malicious user fulfills all those slots with dummy NFTs, then the feature is not usable anymore because the attacker can just do that for each new bounty spawned from the factory.

This is due to the constraint highlighted below.

```solidity
function receiveNft(
        address _sender,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _tokenId,
        uint256 _expiration,
        bytes calldata
    ) external onlyDepositManager nonReentrant returns (bytes32) {
        require(
            nftDeposits.length < nftDepositLimit,   <======================================================
            Errors.NFT_DEPOSIT_LIMIT_REACHED
        );
        require(_expiration > 0, Errors.EXPIRATION_NOT_GREATER_THAN_ZERO);
        _receiveNft(_tokenAddress, _sender, _tokenId);

        bytes32 depositId = _generateDepositId();

        funder[depositId] = _sender;
        tokenAddress[depositId] = _tokenAddress;
        depositTime[depositId] = block.timestamp;
        tokenId[depositId] = _tokenId;
        expiration[depositId] = _expiration;
        isNFT[depositId] = true;

        deposits.push(depositId);
        nftDeposits.push(depositId);
        return depositId;
    }
```

I think this is due to avoid iterating over too many NFTs during claiming in order to prevent reverts because of too high gas but this can be exploited to DoS the feature.

## Impact

Unable to deposit NFTs in any bounty.

## Recommendation

Claiming every ERC-20 and NFT in one transaction is challenging because the contract needs to iterate over every items. A way to workaround that would be to claim rewards per token instead so that the contract can use mappings instead of arrays and it does not have to iterate. This could also help fixing this issue btw: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq-clems4ev3r/issues/12
