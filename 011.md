# Attacker can deposit and refund NFT which leads to DOS in claim functionality

## Summary
Anybody can deposit NFTs to a bounty contract.
The expiration time can be e.g. `1 second` such that the NFT can then be refunded again before any claim can occur.

The `ClaimManagerV1` contract iterates in its claim functions over all NFT deposits.

The issue is that it will try to claim NFTs that have already been refunded.

Thereby the claim will fail.

The attacker can abuse this behavior by depositing an NFT, then withdrawing it.

This will cause subsequent calls to the claim functions to revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
The following functions are used to claim funds from the bounty contracts:

They iterate over all NFT deposits:

The function that gets called is `BountyCore.claimNFT` which transfers the NFT:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L125-L136

This however reverts when the NFT has been refunded.

## Impact
Attacker can cause DOS to the claim functions (`ClaimManagerV1._claimAtomicBounty`, `ClaimManagerV1._claimTieredPercentageBounty`, `ClaimManagerV1._claimTieredFixedBounty`)

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `BountyCore._claimNFT` function must check if the NFT has been refunded.
If it has been refunded, the transfer must not be performed.

```solidity
function claimNft(address _payoutAddress, bytes32 _depositId)
        external
        virtual
        onlyClaimManager
        nonReentrant
    {
        if (!refunded[_depositId]) {
        _transferNft(
            tokenAddress[_depositId],
            _payoutAddress,
            tokenId[_depositId]
        );
       }
    }
```
