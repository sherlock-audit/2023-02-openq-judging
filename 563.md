# `safeTransferFrom` IS CALLED IN THE `BountyCore` CONTRACT WITHOUT APPROVAL FROM THE OWNER.

## Summary

The owner should approve the `BountyCore` contract to transfer the `ERC20` tokens from the owner to its own contract `address(this)`. In the `_receiveERC20()` function of the `BountyCore` contract `safeTransferFrom` is called by the `BountyCore` contract to transfer the `ERC20` tokens from the `_funder` to the `address(this)`. But the `BountyCore` contract is not approved by the `_funder` for the transfer of the `ERC20` token amount of `_volume`.

## Vulnerability Detail

When using the `safeTransferFrom` to transfer `ERC20` tokens from `from` address to another `to` address, the owner must of the tokens must approve the caller of the function `safeTransferFrom` (in this case the `BountyCore` contract) for `_volume` amount of tokens for the transaction to succeed. But the required approval is not performed here.

## Impact

Since the `BountyCore` contract is not approved by the owner of the `ERC20` tokens (in this case `_funder`), to transfer the tokens of amount `_volume` from `_funder` to `address(this)`, the transaction will fail during run time.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function _receiveERC20(
        address _tokenAddress,
        address _funder,
        uint256 _volume
    ) internal virtual returns (uint256) {
        uint256 balanceBefore = getERC20Balance(_tokenAddress);
        IERC20Upgradeable token = IERC20Upgradeable(_tokenAddress);
        token.safeTransferFrom(_funder, address(this), _volume); 
        ...
       }
```

## Tool used

VS Code and Manual Review

## Recommendation

Perform the `SafeApprove()` function, to approve the `BountyCore` contract by the `_funder` (the owner of the `ERC20` tokens) for the `_volume` amount before the `token.safeTransferToken()` function is called by the `BountyCore` contract.
