# Funders lose msg.value if they deposit native token and ERC20 together

## Summary
Funders can deposit funds to a Bounty via the `DepositManagerV1.fundBountyToken` function:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L36

This function then calls `BountyCore.receiveFunds`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L21

When an ERC20 is deposited and `msg.value!=0`, the `msg.value` is lost.
The transaction should revert in case an ERC20 is deposited and `msg.value!=0`.

## Vulnerability Detail
If `_tokenAddress != address(0)` which means an ERC20 is transferred, the following `else` block is executed:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L41-L45

There is no check that no native token is sent i.e. `msg.value==0`.
This means any native token that is sent is lost.

## Impact
Native token can be lost.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `BountyCore.receiveFunds` function should require in the `else` block that msg.value != 0:

```solidity
if (_tokenAddress == address(0)) {
    volumeReceived = msg.value;
} else {
    require(msg.value==0, "Cannot deposited ERC20 and native token");
    volumeReceived = _receiveERC20(_tokenAddress, _funder, _volume);
}
```
