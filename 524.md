# Ongoing bounty contract can be used to run scam bounties promising NFT rewards but not paying them

## Summary
A malicious actor can mint an `OngoingBountyV1` contract and run a scam bounty campaign that promises NFT rewards to winners (optionally, in addition to ERC20 rewards). During claiming, however, winners will get only ERC20 tokens, not NFT tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail
`OngoingBountyV1` allows anyone to deposit NFTs into the contract via the [receiveNFT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/OngoingBountyV1.sol#L133) function (it's always called via [DepositManagerV1.fundBountyNFT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L113)). However, when [claiming rewards from `OngoingBountyV1`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/ClaimManager/Implementations/ClaimManagerV1.sol#L173), only ERC20 tokens are claimed:
```solidity
function _claimOngoingBounty(
    IOngoingBounty _bounty,
    address _closer,
    bytes calldata _closerData
) internal {
    _eligibleToClaimOngoingBounty(_bounty, _closer, _closerData);

    (address tokenAddress, uint256 volume) = _bounty.claimOngoingPayout(
        _closer,
        _closerData
    );
    ...
}
```

This can be exploited in the following scenario:
1. An attacker mints an ongoing bounty contract.
1. The attacker deposits ERC20 and NFT tokens into the contract.
1. The attacker starts a bounty campaign that promises ERC20 + NFT rewards to winners. The contributors see that the contract holds both ERC20 tokens and NFT tokens and trust the malicious minter.
1. The attacker receives contributions from the participants of the program and chooses winners.
1. Winners/attacker trigger payouts. However, instead of receiving ERC20 and NFT tokens as was promised, bounty winners receive only ERC20 tokens.
## Impact
Bounty winners of ongoing bounties may not receive the NFT reward they were promised.

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Due to the nature of ongoing bounty programs (i.e. winners receive equal payments) it doesn't seem to be possible to possible to award ongoing bounty campaigns' winners with NFT tokens. Thus, our recommendation is to remove the `OngoingBountyV1.receiveNft` function to disallow NFT deposits in ongoing bounty contracts.
