# BountyCore: funding goal cannot be set to false when it is true which can make bounties dysfunctional

## Summary
The `BountyCore` contract allows to set a funding goal with the `BountyCore.setFundingGoal` function:

The funding goal is not used on-chain. But it was confirmed by the sponsor that the funding goal is used off-chain.

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue is that once the `hasFundingGoal` variable is set to `true` it cannot be set to `false` again.
This means that when the issuer of the bounty decides to unset the funding goal, he cannot do it.
This can make the contract unable to function properly within the OpenQ ecosystem.

## Impact
Bounty contract can become unusable.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `setFundingGoal` function should have a third parameter that allows to specify whether the funding goal should be `true` or `false`.
