# its possible to set the same winner for multiple tiers

## Summary
in the openQV1 in the setTierWinner function it is possible to set the same winner in multiple tiers of the same bounty
## Vulnerability Detail
when setting the tier winners for a bounty the function is able to accept the same winner for multiple tiers which goes against the ethos of what tiered bountys are. if Alice mints a bounty, Jon, Mark and Bob participate and they all manage to be winner of each tier, then it is possible that Alice can set Bob to be the winner of all tiers or at least more than one
## Impact
this can lead to some winners not actually get paid because there are no checks to make sure each tier winner is different

## Tool used

i modified the setTierWinner in the openQ.test.js and as you can see it accepts the same winner in multiple tiers

  describe.only('setTierWinner', () => {
    it('should set tier winner', async () => {
      // ARRANGE
      await openQProxy.mintBounty(
        Constants.bountyId,
        Constants.organization,
        tieredFixedBountyInitOperation
      )
      const bountyAddress = await openQProxy.bountyIdToAddress(Constants.bountyId)
      const bounty = await TieredFixedBountyV1.attach(bountyAddress)

      // ASSUME
      expect(await bounty.tierWinners(0)).to.equal('')
      expect(await bounty.tierWinners(1)).to.equal('')
      
      

      // ACT
      await openQProxy.setTierWinner(
        Constants.bountyId,
        0,
        Constants.mockOpenQId
      )
      await openQProxy.setTierWinner(
        Constants.bountyId,
        1,
        Constants.mockOpenQId
      )
      

      // ASSERT
      expect(await bounty.tierWinners(0)).to.equal(Constants.mockOpenQId)
      expect(await bounty.tierWinners(1)).to.equal(Constants.mockOpenQId)

## Recommendation
introduce a for loop to iterate through the array and compare each index
