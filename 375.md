# Overflow attack in function `_claimTieredPercentageBounty`

## Summary
Overflow attack is possible to be conducted in `_claimTieredPercentageBounty` function. 

## Vulnerability Detail
I will put an example of attacking the protocol below to show what is the vulnerability is. 

### prerequisite
Especially I want to talk about the condition in `TieredPercentageBountyV1.sol`. 
- According to the code in the repo, although whitelist exists, 
  - Still anyone can fund the bounty. 
  - The token can be any kind of ERC20 token including a customized ERC20 token. 
  - The only condition required is the token addresses limit is not reached. 
(related code is shown here: [DepositManagerV1.sol#L45-L50](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L36-L74))
```solidity
if (!isWhitelisted(_tokenAddress)) { 
     require( 
         !tokenAddressLimitReached(_bountyAddress), 
         Errors.TOO_MANY_TOKEN_ADDRESSES 
     ); 
 } 
```


### Attacking Process
1. The attacker first deploys a customized ERC20 token, and then he can mint a maximum amount of token, e.g. `type(uint256).max`. 
2. Then the attacker can fund any bounty as long as the token addresses limit is not reached, using the customized token to deposit a large amount of token, e.g. `type(uint256).max`. (The related code: [DepositManagerV1.sol#L36-L74](../blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L36-L74))
3. The attacking process of the attacker is done at this moment. 
- After a while when someone wants to claim the token this happens: 
  - When someone tries to claim the bounty, the function `claimTiered ` is called and it will loop through all the tokens to claim the bounty of the attacker. (related code: [ClaimManagerV1.sol#L230-L235](../blob/main/contracts/ClaimManager/Implementations/ClaimManagerV1.sol#L230-L235) 
  - When the loop goes to the malicious customized ERC20 token, during the calculation of the claimable amount the overflow occurs and the transaction will revert. (related code: [TieredPercentageBountyV1.sol#L115-L116](../blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/TieredPercentageBountyV1.sol#L115-L116))

### Attacking example
- Case 1
  - The issuer is the person who funded all of the bounty's funds. He decided to ask someone for helping build his website. After the funding, he can utilize this attack to make the bounty unable to be claimed. After the victim finished the job, he refund the token and run away. 
- Case 2
  - The issuer pretends to be another address and he funded the bounty to ask someone to help him build a website. 
  - He can control the tier's percentage and set a 3rd tier as 10%, 1st place as 50%, 2nd place as 40%, for example. 
  - Then he sent the malicious token amount of `type(uint256).max / 10` to the bounty as unwhitelisted token award. 
  - As a result of this action and according to code snippet below, what can happen is: 
    - Due to the overflow of the line `(payoutSchedule[_tier] * fundingTotals[_tokenAddress]) / 100` only the 3rd place can claim the award
    - 1st and 2nd place are not able to claim the reward
  - The issuer can pretend to be the 3rd place address in this case.


In terms of implementing the attack, the biggest funder usually has the biggest incentive to conduct the attack. However, anyone who fund the bounty can have the incentive. Or someone else who just wants to be a nuisance.  


## Impact
This prevents the winner of the tier from getting proper funding. 
Malicious player can deposit customized ERC20 token to deny the winner's bounty, making nobody can claim the bounty. As such the protocol's service can be broken and denied by any malicious attacker.

## Tool used

Manual Review + hardhat script

## Recommendation
- Use the whitelist to limit the tokens can be used in the protocol. As a result of this, no one can use his randomly created malicious token to break the protocol. 
  - And in our honest opinion, generally speaking people want to only get paid in several trusted tokens. Using random tokens can increase the exposure of risks to users and making the protocol too complex to be trusted. 

```solidity
if (!isWhitelisted(_tokenAddress)) { 
  revert("Token isn't whitelisted");
 } 
```
- Avoid using loop to claim all of the tokens in one transaction. Create a function to allow the claiming of only one kind of token by the claimer.
