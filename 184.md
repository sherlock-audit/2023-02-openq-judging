# Bounty doesn't work as expected with token revert transferring with amount = 0

## Summary
There are some type of ERC20 which revert the transferring when amount = 0

## Vulnerability Detail
`TieredPercentageBountyV1` is a contest which pays a percentage amount to multiple developers one time  based on each claimants' tier, e.g. in a hackathon with 1st, 2nd and 3rd place. 
When a winner claim their rewards, for each token the bounty will calculate the amount of tokens corresponding to the percentage of the tier can gain by formula: 
```solidity=
uint256 claimedBalance = (payoutSchedule[_tier] * fundingTotals[_tokenAddress]) / 100;
```
This `claimedBalance` can be equal to 0 when `payoutSchedule[_tier] * fundingTotals[_tokenAddress] < 100`. This will make the function `TieredPercentageBountyV1.claimTiered()` revert in case the `_tokenAddress` is a [weird ERC20](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#revert-on-zero-value-transfers) which revert when transferring 0 amount. Then it will incur the failure of function `ClaimManagerV1._claimTieredPercentageBounty()` when a winner are trying to claim their rewards. 
Note that this issue appear in `AtomicBounty` and `TieredFixedBounty` when the balance of `payoutAddress` is equal to 0 due to the refunding. 

## Impact
User can't claim the rewards
