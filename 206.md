# claimOngoingPayout does not check claimId[_claimId]

## Summary
When OngoingBountyV1.claimOngoingPayout is called, claimId[_claimId] is set to true, indicating that the _claimId has already been claimed, but claimId[_claimId] is not checked to ensure that the _claimId has not been claimed.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a prize is claimed in Ongoing Bounty, claimId[_claimId] is set to true in OngoingBountyV1.claimOngoingPayout to indicate that the _claimId has already been claimed, but there is no check on claimId[_claimId] here. This results in OngoingBountyV1.claimOngoingPayout being called multiple times.
```solidity
    function claimOngoingPayout(
        address _payoutAddress,
        bytes calldata _closerData
    ) external onlyClaimManager nonReentrant returns (address, uint256) {
        (, string memory claimant, , string memory claimantAsset) = abi.decode(
            _closerData,
            (address, string, address, string)
        );

        bytes32 _claimId = generateClaimId(claimant, claimantAsset);

        claimId[_claimId] = true;
```
ClaimManagerV1._eligibleToClaimOngoingBounty also does not check claimId[_claimId], which results in the prize in Ongoing Bounty being claimed multiple times.
```solidity
    function _eligibleToClaimOngoingBounty(
        IOngoingBounty bounty,
        address _closer,
        bytes memory _closerData
    ) internal view {
        require(
            bounty.status() == OpenQDefinitions.OPEN,
            Errors.CONTRACT_IS_NOT_CLAIMABLE
        );

        (, string memory claimant, , string memory claimantAsset) = abi.decode(
            _closerData,
            (address, string, address, string)
        );

        bytes32 claimId = bounty.generateClaimId(claimant, claimantAsset);
```
Unlike this, _eligibleToClaimTier/claimTiered/claimTieredFixed all check the tierClaimed.

Considering that _claimOngoingBounty needs to be called by oracle, it should be a mid-risk

## Impact
It results in the prize in Ongoing Bounty being claimed multiple times.
