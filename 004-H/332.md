# Block All Refunds By Adding Many Deposits

## Summary
Although the amount of token addresses are limited to avoid DoS, the amount of deposits are not limited.

To receive a refund, every deposit must be looped through to determine how much of the token balance is currently able to be refunded. This array can be arbitrarily increased to make it out-of-gas on every attempt to get a refund, therefore completely DoSing a user's ability to get a refund.

When combined with a DoS on claims, this will permanently lose all funds in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Create many deposits with a very small amount of Ether each.
2. Once you have enough, any attempts at refunds will revert.
3. This can lead to permanent loss of all funds in the contract.

## Impact
High because it can lead to permanent loss of all funds.

These lines show where claims require this loop to be run and the loop that is being run.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I'm not sure exactly what would be best for you guys, but maybe a minimum amount of tokens to be deposited, a maximum amount of deposits, or another way of determining locked funds amount that doesn't require a loop.
