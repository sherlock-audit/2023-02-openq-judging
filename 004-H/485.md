# `refundDeposit` will not work when `deposits` array grows bigger or deliberately increased to huge value.

## Summary

The funder can withdrew their deposited value by calling the `refundDeposit` function in `DepositManagerV1.sol` contract once the locked time is expired.

`refundDeposit` function calls the `getLockedFunds`. This function traverse the deposit list array and get the locked fund value.

The issue here is the getLockedFunds should traverse the array to get the locked fund value for refunding process.

When the `deposits` array grows bigger then the refunding would be DOSed due to out of gas issue.

## Vulnerability Detail

There are two cases how the `deposits` grow bigger.

1. When user fund more time with valid amount.
2. When user fund with msg.value = 0. This could cost the gas for transaction.

The second scenario could happen due to current code flow where it is not checking the msg.value > 0 during `fundBountyToken` call

`fundBountyToken` -> `receiveFunds`


    function receiveFunds(
        address _funder,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _volume,
        uint256 _expiration
    )
        external
        payable
        virtual
        onlyDepositManager
        nonReentrant
        returns (bytes32, uint256)
    {
        require(_volume != 0, Errors.ZERO_VOLUME_SENT);
        require(_expiration > 0, Errors.EXPIRATION_NOT_GREATER_THAN_ZERO);
        require(status == OpenQDefinitions.OPEN, Errors.CONTRACT_IS_CLOSED);


        bytes32 depositId = _generateDepositId();


        uint256 volumeReceived;
        if (_tokenAddress == address(0)) {
            volumeReceived = msg.value; ------------------------------> audit find. no check to ensure that the msg.value is > 0
        } else {
            volumeReceived = _receiveERC20(_tokenAddress, _funder, _volume);
        }


        funder[depositId] = _funder;
        tokenAddress[depositId] = _tokenAddress;
        volume[depositId] = volumeReceived; --------------- audit find. fund value is updated. no loss to the sender other than the transaction cost.
        depositTime[depositId] = block.timestamp;
        expiration[depositId] = _expiration;
        isNFT[depositId] = false;


        deposits.push(depositId); -------------> array size is increased.
        tokenAddresses.add(_tokenAddress);

 

## Impact

refund deposit can be parlayed by DOS attack. Fund can struck and no refund could takes place.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
we would suggest to use the map instead of array to store.
