# Locked funds do not account for claims and refunds

## Summary

The actual token balance might be less than the locked tokens leading to blocked refunds.

## Vulnerability Detail

When calculating the refundable amount it subtracts the locked amount from the token balance:
```solidity
    function refundDeposit(address _bountyAddress, bytes32 _depositId)
        external
        onlyProxy
    {
        ...
        uint256 availableFunds = bounty.getTokenBalance(depToken) -
            bounty.getLockedFunds(depToken);
```

The locked funds are calculated by iterating over all the deposits and adding the volume if the deposit has not expired:
```solidity
    function getLockedFunds(address _depositId)
        public
        view
        virtual
        returns (uint256)
    {
        uint256 lockedFunds;
        bytes32[] memory depList = this.getDeposits();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < depList.length; i++) {
            if (
                block.timestamp <
                depositTime[depList[i]] + expiration[depList[i]] &&
                tokenAddress[depList[i]] == _depositId
            ) {
                lockedFunds += volume[depList[i]];
            }
        }

        return lockedFunds;
    }
```

There are at least 2 possible harmful situations that could bring to the state where `bounty.getTokenBalance(depToken)` is actually less than `bounty.getLockedFunds(depToken)` leading to the runtime revert and blocked refunds:

1) There are no restrictions on when the user can refund. Some claims have already happened and drained the balance of the token from the contract. The remaining balance is less than the total locked funds because the system does not delete/update deposits and amounts once claimed.

2) If someone refunds first, the balance of the contract is reduced, but their deposit is not deleted, thus leading to an invalid state when the others decide to refund their deposits.

## Impact

I assume that the current implementation of refunds only works for the first refunder and only when the claims haven't happened. Otherwise, it is impossible to refund.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`getLockedFunds` should probably skip the deposit if it is refunded. Also should subtract claimed amount somehow.
