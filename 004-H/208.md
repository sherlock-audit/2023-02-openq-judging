# Refunds can be blocked by deposits

## Summary
Excess deposits can block deposit refunds

## Vulnerability Detail
In DepositManagerV1.sol, a depositor can get a refund for their deposits by calling `refundDeposit()`. The `availableFunds` are then calculated by looping through the deposit list and validating the `lockedFunds`. This is problematic because anyone can create deposits. An attacker (or legitimate users) can deposit dust amounts and cause this array to get too big. The loop would then cause this validation to run out of gas. 

## Impact

## Code Snippet
There is no validation for the size of deposit

## Tool used

At the last line of this snippet, the `availableFunds` are calculated. A loop is used in `bounty.getLockedFunds(depToken)`

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Consider a minimum deposit amount to reduce this attack vector
