# Invoice or supportingDocuments can be marked as completed even if it is not required

## Summary
Invoice or supportingDocuments can be marked as completed even if it is not required.

## Vulnerability Detail
We have setInvoiceComplete and setSupportingDocumentsComplete functions in

- AtomicBountyV1.sol
- OngoingBountyV1.sol
- TieredBountyCore.sol

Let's take the functions in AtomicBounty as an example.

```solidity
    function setInvoiceComplete(bytes calldata _data) external onlyOpenQ {
        bool _invoiceComplete = abi.decode(_data, (bool));
        invoiceComplete = _invoiceComplete;
    }
```

```solidity
    function setSupportingDocumentsComplete(bytes calldata _data)
        external
        onlyOpenQ
    {
        bool _supportingDocumentsComplete = abi.decode(_data, (bool));
        supportingDocumentsComplete = _supportingDocumentsComplete;
    }
```

In the functions abovementioned, the invoiceComplete and supportingDocumentsComplete flags can be updated to true even though the following variables in BountyStorageCore.sol are not updated to true

```solidity
bool public invoiceRequired;
bool public supportingDocumentsRequired;
```

## Impact
The system is able to set invoices and supportingDocuments to completed even though they are not required.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change all the setInvoiceComplete and setSupportingDocumentsComplete functions. Add the checking invoice or supportingDocuments is required before setting them to completed.

Let's take AtomicBountyV1.sol as an example, and change the following code.

```solidity
   function setInvoiceComplete(bytes calldata _data) external onlyOpenQ {
        bool _invoiceComplete = abi.decode(_data, (bool));

        +++ if(_invoiceComplete){
        +++     require(invoiceRequired, 'Invoice is required to set invoice to completed');
        +++ }

        invoiceComplete = _invoiceComplete;
    }
```

```solidity
   function setSupportingDocumentsComplete(bytes calldata _data)
        external
        onlyOpenQ
    {
        bool _supportingDocumentsComplete = abi.decode(_data, (bool));

        +++ if(_supportingDocumentsComplete){
        +++  require(supportingDocumentsRequired, 'Supporting documents is required to set supporting documents to completed');
        +++ }

        supportingDocumentsComplete = _supportingDocumentsComplete;
    }
```
