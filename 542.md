# Some winners of tiered percentage bounty can't claim their payouts



## Summary
Some winners of tiered percentage bounty can't claim their payouts due to lack of payout balance.

## Vulnerability Detail

For a tiered percentage bounty, the issuer can change the payout schedule after some winners claim their payouts because there is no check about claimed status in `setPayoutSchedule`.

`setPayoutSchedule` only checks if the sum of new payout schedule is 100 and doesn't make sure that it doesn't change claimed payout schedule. (TieredPercentageBountyV1.sol#L149-L155)

```solidity
        uint256 sum;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _payoutSchedule.length; i++) {
            sum += _payoutSchedule[i];
        }
        require(sum == 100, Errors.PAYOUT_SCHEDULE_MUST_ADD_TO_100);

        payoutSchedule = _payoutSchedule;
```
This can prevent clamers from claiming due to lack of payout balance.
For example, let us assume that `payoutSchedule` was [80, 20] for simplicity and the winner of tier 0 has claimed already. If the issuer changed the schedule to [70, 30] by fault, it passes the checks of `setPayoutSchedule` because the sum is also 100. When the winner of tier 1 wants to claim his payout, he will claim 30 percent of `fundingTotals`. (TieredPercentageBountyV1.sol#L115-L118)

```solidity
        uint256 claimedBalance = (payoutSchedule[_tier] *
            fundingTotals[_tokenAddress]) / 100;

        _transferToken(_tokenAddress, claimedBalance, _payoutAddress);
```
But the winner of tier 0 already has claimed 80 percent of `fundingTotals` and 20 percent left in the bounty. So the bounty can't transfer 30 percent to the claimer due to lack of balance.

## Impact
Claimers can't claim their payouts for tiered percentage bounty.
