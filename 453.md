# Use of Rebase Tokens can lead to loss of funds for organization

## Summary

Rebasing tokens are tokens that have each holderâ€™s balanceof() increase over time. Aave aTokens are an example of such tokens. While claiming, the contract transfers complete balance of the contract to the user which can be more than what it started with.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `claimBalance` method of `AtomicBountyV1`, it just transfer the complete balance the contract holds to the claimer. This is fine with normal tokens but when any organization uses Rebase Tokens whose balance increase over time, then it will transfer the amount with surplus to the claimer. As there is no way to withdraw that surplus amount, organization will lose their funds.

## Impact

If rebasing tokens are used to fund bounty, rewards accrue on the contract and are transfered completely to the user who claims successfully. This leads to Loss of funds for organization.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: AtomicBountyV1.sol

    function claimBalance(address _payoutAddress, address _tokenAddress)
        external
        onlyClaimManager
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256)
    {
        uint256 claimedBalance = getTokenBalance(_tokenAddress);
        _transferToken(_tokenAddress, claimedBalance, _payoutAddress);
        return claimedBalance;
    }

```
