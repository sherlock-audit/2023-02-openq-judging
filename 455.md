# OpenQ is not compatible with rebasing tokens

## Summary
Rebasing tokens will accrue extra tokens to holders over time and require specific accounting to keep track of tokens owed to users.

## Vulnerability Detail
OpenQ does not properly track user balances for rebasing tokens.

## Impact
Internal accounting will not match the proper balances users are owed for rebasing tokens. They will miss out on the gains that have accrued over time.

## Recommendation
Either restrict rebasing tokens from being whitelisted, or modify the accounting to accommodate rebasing tokens.
