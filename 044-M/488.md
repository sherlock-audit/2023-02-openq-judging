# OpenQ cannot accept rebasing token

## Summary

The protocol cannot accept rebasing tokens. When a rebase occurs, the supply of the tokens are increased or decreased. If a user deposits a rebasing token into a bounty. It would record the received volume. But since the supply of the token would change, the recorded volume is absolutely wrong.

## Vulnerability Detail

`BountyCore.receiveFunds` would record the received volume of the deposited token.

```solidity
    function receiveFunds(
        address _funder,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _volume,
        uint256 _expiration
    )
        external
        payable
        virtual
        onlyDepositManager
        nonReentrant
        returns (bytes32, uint256)
    {
        â€¦
        if (_tokenAddress == address(0)) {
            volumeReceived = msg.value;
        } else {
            volumeReceived = _receiveERC20(_tokenAddress, _funder, _volume);
        }

        funder[depositId] = _funder;
        tokenAddress[depositId] = _tokenAddress;
        volume[depositId] = volumeReceived;
        depositTime[depositId] = block.timestamp;
        expiration[depositId] = _expiration;
        isNFT[depositId] = false;

        deposits.push(depositId);
        tokenAddresses.add(_tokenAddress);

        return (depositId, volumeReceived);
    }
```

But the supply of a rebasing token changes from time to time. The recorded volume is not correct when you try to refund.

## Impact

Recording the received volume of a rebasing token is meaningless. And it could cause the loss of funds when refunding.

## Recommendation

Do not use the rebasing token in OpenQ.
