# Variable balance token in payout causing fund loss or DoS

## Summary

Some ERC20 token's balance could change, one example is stETH. The balance could become lower or higher later. As a result, the balance of the contract could be different at the time of payout and refund. Some users may get inaccurate amount of fund, too high or too low. The contract could DoS due to low balance.


## Vulnerability Detail

However in payout and refund functions, the accounting is based on the spot transferred amount and balance. When handling payout or refund, users could receive incorrect amount. Some may get more than deserved, some could get less and lose some payout. The contract might even DoS due to low balance.

The following functions could be affected: 
- BountyCore.sol:refundDeposit()
- AtomicBountyV1.sol:claimBalance()
- OngoingBountyV1.sol:claimOngoingPayout()
- TieredFixedBountyV1.sol:claimTieredFixed()
- TieredPercentageBountyV1.sol:claimTiered()

## Impact

- users could receive inaccurate amount, too high or too.low. 
- the protocol could DoS due to not enough balance.

## Recommendation

Do not allow such kind of variable balance token  to be used, such as stETH.
