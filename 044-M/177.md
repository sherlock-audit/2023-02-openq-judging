# Function `DepositManagerV1.refundDeposit()` doesn't support Rebase ERC20 tokens

## Summary
Rebase ERC20 tokens aren't supported
 
## Vulnerability Detail

Based on the On-chain context, rebasing tokens are supported in openQ protocol. Unfortunately this support seem uncorrect with function `DepositManagerV1.refundDeposit()`
```solidity=
function refundDeposit(address _bountyAddress, bytes32 _depositId)
        external
        onlyProxy
    {
        /// ... 
        
        uint256 volume;
        if (bounty.volume(_depositId) <= availableFunds) {
            volume = bounty.volume(_depositId);
        } else {
            volume = availableFunds;
        }

        bounty.refundDeposit(_depositId, msg.sender, volume);
        
        /// ... 
    }
```
In case the `bounty.volume(_depositId) <= availableFunds`, the bounty will refund the exact amount of tokens the funder deposits which was capture in `bounty.volume(_depositId)`. Assume the funder deposits x tokens at time 10, then he decide to withdraw his deposit at time 20, at that time he will be transfered x tokens into his wallet. But if the erc20 is rebasing token, the amount shouldn't be equal to x at time 20. (maybe a lot of rebasing event has been appeared during the period [10, 20])

## Impact
Funders doesn't receive amount of rebasing tokens as expected

## Recommendation
Consider not to support rebasing tokens.
