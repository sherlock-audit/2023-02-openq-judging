# Claimant cannot claim any of the assets they should receive if any of these assets is blacklisted

## Summary
Because in both `_claimAtomic()` and `_claimTierPercentageBounty()`, all assets are transferred to users atomically, i.e. either all transfers are successful, or all fails, if user happens to have an asset such that their address is on the blacklist, it will prevent them from being able to claim any of the other ERC20 tokens, as well as NFTs.

## Vulnerability Detail
In both `_claimAtomic()` and `_claimTierPercentageBounty()`, ERC20 token addresses of the bounty are looped through and transferred to claimant one by one. This is a push method of paying rewards. However, some ERC20 tokens such as USDT has a blacklist function. If a user is blacklisted, the transfer to their address will revert, and this would prevent them from being ever able to claim any other assets.

## Impact
User cannot claim any of their asset if even one of the assets have them blacklisted.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using a pull method of claiming tokens instead. Otherwise, we can use a `try` clause to continue transferring tokens even if one fails.
