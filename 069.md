# Attacker can block user from claiming AtomicBountyV1 by depositing token that doesn't support 0 transfer and then refunding

## Summary
Attacker can block user from claiming AtomicBountyV1 by depositing token that doesn't support 0 transfer and then refunding
## Vulnerability Detail
`ClaimManagerV1 ._claimAtomicBounty` function is responsible for claiming tokens for user.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/ClaimManager/Implementations/ClaimManagerV1.sol#L123-L166
```solidity
    function _claimAtomicBounty(
        IAtomicBounty _bounty,
        address _closer,
        bytes calldata _closerData
    ) internal {
        _eligibleToClaimAtomicBounty(_bounty, _closer);


        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _bounty.getTokenAddresses().length; i++) {
            uint256 volume = _bounty.claimBalance(
                _closer,
                _bounty.getTokenAddresses()[i]
            );


            emit TokenBalanceClaimed(
                _bounty.bountyId(),
                address(_bounty),
                _bounty.organization(),
                _closer,
                block.timestamp,
                _bounty.getTokenAddresses()[i],
                volume,
                _bounty.bountyType(),
                _closerData,
                VERSION_1
            );
        }


        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _bounty.getNftDeposits().length; i++) {
            _bounty.claimNft(_closer, _bounty.nftDeposits(i));


            emit NFTClaimed(
                _bounty.bountyId(),
                address(_bounty),
                _bounty.organization(),
                _closer,
                block.timestamp,
                _bounty.tokenAddress(_bounty.nftDeposits(i)),
                _bounty.tokenId(_bounty.nftDeposits(i)),
                _bounty.bountyType(),
                _closerData,
                VERSION_1
            );
        }
    }
```
It iterates over all tokens that were deposited and then calls `_bounty.claimBalance`, which will [transfer all balance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/AtomicBountyV1.sol#L89-L98) to recipient.

There is one more important thing here. Anyone can make deposit into bounty contract and then refund.
When you deposit, then token address [is added to tokenAddresses list](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L55).
But when you refund, this token is not removed from the list if balance is 0.

This can be used by attacker in order to make user do not receive any payment
1.User works with bounty.
2.Attacker deposits small amount of not malicious token  that doesn't support 0 value transfers and set expiration to 1 second. token is added to the list.
3.Attacker refunds his deposit. Token is not removed from list.
4.When claiming rewards tx will revert as bounty contract will try to transfer 0 amount of tokens that doesn't support that.
5.As result user can't claim rewards.

I believe this is medium, as it's possible to donate some amount of that token to the contract in order to claim. But this is temporal funds freeze, so i believe it's valid medium.
## Impact
Attacker blocks user from claiming rewards.

## Recommendation
Remove token from `tokenAddresses` after refund, when balance of contract is 0.
