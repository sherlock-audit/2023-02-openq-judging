# When using ClaimManagerV1.claimBounty to claim prize in TieredBounty, there is no verification that closer is tierWinner

## Summary
When using ClaimManagerV1.claimBounty to claim prize in TieredBounty, there is no verification that closer is tierWinner
## Vulnerability Detail
In permissionedClaimTieredBounty, it is required that msg.sender is a tierWinner
```solidity
        string memory closer = IOpenQ(openQ).addressToExternalUserId(
            msg.sender
        );

        require(
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(closer)) !=
                keccak256(abi.encodePacked('')),
            Errors.NO_ASSOCIATED_ADDRESS
        );

        require(
            keccak256(abi.encode(closer)) ==
                keccak256(abi.encode(bounty.tierWinners(_tier))),
            Errors.CLAIMANT_NOT_TIER_WINNER
        );
```
When using ClaimManagerV1.claimBounty to claim prize in TieredBounty, the caller can specify any closer, but does not require closer is a tierWinner. If closer is not a tierWinner, this may prevent other tierWinners from claiming the prize since closer will claim a prize.
Consider alice/bob owning 50% of the prize in the TieredPercentageBounty, and ClaimManagerV1.claimBounty claiming 50% of the prize for charlie, then alice or bob will not be able to claim his prize
## Impact
It may prevent other tierWinners from claiming the prize
