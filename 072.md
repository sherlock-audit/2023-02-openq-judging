# No Storge Gap for Upgradeable Contracts

## Summary
Storage of `OpenQV1` and `ClaimManagerV1` can be corrupted during an upgrade. 

## Vulnerability Detail
When dealing with upgradeability in the system with multi-level inheritance, if a new variable is introduced in a parent contract, that addition can potentially overwrite the beginning of the storage layout of the child contract, causing criticial misbehaviours in the system.

The OpenQV1 and ClaimManagerV1 are meant to upgradeable and has also inherited the openzeppelin upgradeable contracts which already defines the formentioned gap. However no gap storage is implemented on the `Oraclize` contract inherited by `OpenQV1` and `ClaimManagerV1`. 

## Impact
Storage of `OpenQV1` and `ClaimManagerV1` can be corrupted

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

For custom contracts, consider preventing these scenarios by defining a storage gap in each upgradeable parent contract at the end of storage variable

```solidity
uint256[50] __gap; // gap to reserve storage in the contract for future variable additions
```
