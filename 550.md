# possible grief attack on bounty refund deposit call

## Summary
Any depositor/funder has the ability to be refunded after the bounty expiries by calling `DepositorManagerV1#refundDeposit` method.

An malicious user can block this call by supplying enough deposits to block the calculation of `Bounty#getLockedFunds` that is called internally by `refundDeposit`.

## Vulnerability Detail
A malicious user can create many legit deposit supplying small amount (example of 1 WEI) of legit ERC20 token.
Or if the bounty has not reached `TOKEN_ADDRESS_LIMIT` he can use a fake (no value) ERC20 token to supply many valueless deposits trough the call of

When is time for a user getting a refund the following for loop is used

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L340-L348

Which fetches all deposits ever made to the bounty

```solidity
bytes32[] memory depList = this.getDeposits(); 
```

and checks **every deposit made** that is the one made with the right token address for the user supplied deposit id.

```solidity
                tokenAddress[depList[i]] == _depositId
```

Note: _depositId is the ERC20 tokenAddress that the deposit was made for

If there are many deposits it can be too expensive for the loop and use all supplied gas and revert.

## Impact
Malicious user can block (or make it more expensive) the protocol functionality of refunding users so the ERC20 tokens are blocked inside the bounty contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A simple solution would be when depositing funds with ERC20 require a minimum deposit amount.  In this case a better approach would be to let the bounty owner specify what is a minimum amount per ERC20 token.
