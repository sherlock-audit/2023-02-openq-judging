# `fundingTotals` is not accounted for when deposits are refunded

## Summary
When a funder chooses to refund their deposit, the contract does not update `fundingTotals`. When a claim is made after deposits are refunded, claimed amount still uses the value of the balance before deposit to calculate claim amount for users. This affects claims that are made when bounty type is TieredPercentageBountyV1.

## Vulnerability Detail
`fundingTotals[]` array is updated when the first claim is made via `_claimTieredPercentageBounty()` and `closeCompetition()` is called.

```solidity
function closeCompetition() external onlyClaimManager {
	require(
		status == OpenQDefinitions.OPEN,
		Errors.CONTRACT_ALREADY_CLOSED
	);

	status = OpenQDefinitions.CLOSED;
	bountyClosedTime = block.timestamp;

	for (uint256 i = 0; i < getTokenAddresses().length; i++) {
		address _tokenAddress = getTokenAddresses()[i];
		fundingTotals[_tokenAddress] = getTokenBalance(_tokenAddress);
	}
}
```

The volume of tokens that a claimant should get is calculated in this way.

> uint256 claimedBalance = (payoutSchedule[_tier] * fundingTotals[_tokenAddress]) / 100;

Any depositors can call `refundDeposit()` to refund their deposit as long as expiration time has been reached. 

If a refund is made after the first claim is made, subsequent claims by other claimants will claim a wrong amount. We can illustrate this with a simple example.

Say our tiered percentage bounty has 2 deposits and we have 3 tiers.

Deposit 1 - 1000USDC
Deposit 2 - 600USDC

fundingTotals = 1600USDC

Tier 1 receives 50%, tier 2 receives 30%, tier 3 receives 20%.

Tier 1 claims first, and receives 800 USDC. `fundingTotals array is updated to be 1600USDC at the same time.

Now, assuming that all funds are unlocked, i.e. all expirations has been reached, with 800 USDC remaining in the contract, Deposit 2 can be refunded. 600USDC is refunded to second depositor. Contract is left with 200USDC but `fundingTotals[]` array amount is still 1600USDC. min(20%,30%) of 1600 = 320, hence neither tier 2 winner or tier 3 winner can claim their rewards and remaining 200USDC will be stuck in contract.

Note that in cases where the lowest tier % winner's claim amount is less than what is in the contract, they can claim more than they are supposedly allowed to.

## Impact
Assets can be stuck in the contract, some claimants will be not able to claim rewards if a depositor refunds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider decreasing the respective `fundingTotals[]` value when refunds are made.
