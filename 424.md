# Insufficient check for expiration time for deposits.

## Summary
There is no upper bound for duration of expiration time when we `receiveFunds()`, `receiveNft` and `extendDeposit()`. There is little reason for any users to want to make a deposit with infinitely high expiration time.

An expiration time that is set too high, can lock deposits of users perpetually.

## Vulnerability Detail

Assets can be first deposited into bounties with `receieveFunds()` or `receiveNft()` with a set expiration time. The only check on expiration time is that it must be more than 0. There is no maximum cap on expiration time.

This expiration time can then be extended using `extendDeposit()`. Similarly, expiration time can be extended with no limit.

## Impact
An expiration time that is allowed to be set to an arbitrarily high value can be dangerous as it essentially "locks" and prevents funds from being able to be refunded if no one claims the deposits.

## Recommendation
Consider setting an upper limit for when expiration is set.
