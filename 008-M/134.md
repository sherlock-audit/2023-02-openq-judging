# ClaimBounty () If any NFT has refund, it will lead to failure to claim other bounty

## Summary

Lack of checking whether NFT has been refund leads to the failure of user claimBounty() forever.

## Vulnerability Detail

If need to claim a bonus, oracle will call ClaimManagerV1.claimBounty ().

in claimBounty(), call _bounty.claimNft () circularly to transfer the NFT stored in the bounty contract to the winner.

"Atomic" as an example and other types are in the same way. The code is as follows:
```solidity
    function _claimAtomicBounty(
        IAtomicBounty _bounty,
        address _closer,
        bytes calldata _closerData
    ) internal {
...
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _bounty.getNftDeposits().length; i++) {
            _bounty.claimNft(_closer, _bounty.nftDeposits(i));    //@audit <--------Loop call claimNft for all NftDeposits
```
_bounty.claimNft():

```solidity
    function claimNft(address _payoutAddress, bytes32 _depositId)
        external
        virtual
        onlyClaimManager
        nonReentrant
    {
        _transferNft(  //audit <--------don't check whether the deposit is refund, just call nft.safeTransferFrom()
            tokenAddress[_depositId],
            _payoutAddress,
            tokenId[_depositId]
        );
    }
```

There is a problem: the deposit that has been refund will still be called to perform NFT  transfer, but the NFT's owner is not the bounty contract,  resulting in claimBounty() will  revert. 
Because:
1. after refund,  the deposit is still in nftDeposits array, so it will still be called claimNft ().
2. It is not check whether the deposit is refund within the claimNft () method.

Reason for refund: issuer may switch other NFT prizes, or it may be a malicious attack.

## Impact

failure to claim bounty.

## Recommendation

check refund in claimNft()

```solidity
    function claimNft(address _payoutAddress, bytes32 _depositId)
        external
        virtual
        onlyClaimManager
        nonReentrant
    {
+      if (refunded[_depositId]) return;
        _transferNft(
            tokenAddress[_depositId],
            _payoutAddress,
            tokenId[_depositId]
        );
    }
```
