# Any bounty payment can be blocked by a malicious user funding with an nft

## Summary
For bounties of type `TieredFixed`, `TieredPercentage`, `Atomic`, any user can fund using an NFT (choosing the tier if tiered bounty). They can also request a refund of the deposit recovering their NFT. Unfortunately that can lead to blocking all payouts for the bounty. 

## Vulnerability Detail
when claiming tiered/atomic bounties, `nftDeposits` array is queried for deciding if a given tier should receive an nft.

if the nft has been refunded, the entry in the array is still here, but the nft transfer would fail.

## Impact
Any bounty payment can be blocked by a malicious user funding with an nft.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update nftDeposits mapping when nfts are refunded, or skip the nfts in the loop when claiming.

Please note that it is not sufficient to just check that `address(this)` is the holder of the NFT, since the attacker could cause another griefing by stuffing the array with repeated deposit/refund
