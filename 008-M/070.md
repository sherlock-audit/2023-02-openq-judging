# BountyCore.claimNft doesn't check that nft is not refunded

## Summary
This issue is similar to my #4 issue, but it's not the same and the problem is little bit different here.

BountyCore.claimNft doesn't check that nft is not refunded. Because of that claiming can fail.
## Vulnerability Detail
`ClaimManagerV1 ._claimAtomicBounty` function is responsible for claiming tokens for user.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/ClaimManager/Implementations/ClaimManagerV1.sol#L123-L166
```solidity
    function _claimAtomicBounty(
        IAtomicBounty _bounty,
        address _closer,
        bytes calldata _closerData
    ) internal {
        _eligibleToClaimAtomicBounty(_bounty, _closer);


        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _bounty.getTokenAddresses().length; i++) {
            uint256 volume = _bounty.claimBalance(
                _closer,
                _bounty.getTokenAddresses()[i]
            );


            emit TokenBalanceClaimed(
                _bounty.bountyId(),
                address(_bounty),
                _bounty.organization(),
                _closer,
                block.timestamp,
                _bounty.getTokenAddresses()[i],
                volume,
                _bounty.bountyType(),
                _closerData,
                VERSION_1
            );
        }


        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _bounty.getNftDeposits().length; i++) {
            _bounty.claimNft(_closer, _bounty.nftDeposits(i));


            emit NFTClaimed(
                _bounty.bountyId(),
                address(_bounty),
                _bounty.organization(),
                _closer,
                block.timestamp,
                _bounty.tokenAddress(_bounty.nftDeposits(i)),
                _bounty.tokenId(_bounty.nftDeposits(i)),
                _bounty.bountyType(),
                _closerData,
                VERSION_1
            );
        }
    }
```

As you can see this function iterates over all nft deposits and calls `_bounty.claimNft`, which should [transfer nft](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L125-L136).
The problem is that once [deposit with nft is created](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/AtomicBountyV1.sol#L149) and `nftDeposits` array is increased it [can be refunded](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L80-L86), as well.

In this case deposit is set as [refunded](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L76), but `nftDeposits` array still contains that deposit.

So actually, after refunding, contract doesn't contain token anymore and `_bounty.claimNft` for that nftDeposit which was not deleted after refund will fail.

I believe this is high severity issue, because attacker can make it impossible for user to claim his rewards.
He just need to deposit whitelisted nft and then refund it. After that claimer will not receive payments. 
## Impact
Full lost of funds for claimer which costs nothing for attacker.

## Recommendation
You can resolve that be several ways. 
1.Just check if you control nft.
2.When looping through nft deposits, check if they are refunded
3.Remove nft deposit when refunded.
