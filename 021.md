# Attacker can front-run refund functionality such that user receives less funds than expected

## Summary
Deposits can be refunded when the expiration is reached.

The amount that is refunded is capped at the `availableFunds` amount:

Therefore an attacker can front-run a victim that wants to refund his funds.

The victim then receives less funds than expected.

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently only one refund is possible.
So a victim that performs one refund and receives less funds than expected due to front-running cannot perform a second refund and refund the remaining funds.

So the remaining funds are lost.

## Impact
The victim receives less funds than expected.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It should be possible to perform multiple refunds until a user has refunded the amount that has initially been deposited.
Currently only one refund is possible.
So a victim that performs one refund and receives less funds than expected cannot perform a second refund and refund the remaining funds.
