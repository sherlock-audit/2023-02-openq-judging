# Will lock ETH in the contract

## Summary
In the DepositManagerV1 contract fundBountyToken(), when the tokenaddress is ETH, the sent msg.value will be passed to receiveFunds() in the BountyCore contract. But if the tokenaddress is not ETH. But still send ETH to the DepositManagerV1 contract, then the sent ETH will be locked in the contract. unable to take out

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When tokenaddress==address(0), judge msg.value==0
