# Refunded NFT can indefinitely block bounty rewards claiming

## Summary
Claiming bounties from some bounty contracts (`AtomicBountyV1`, `TieredPercentageBountyV1`, and `TieredFixedBountyV1`) can be blocked indefinitely after at least one NFT token was refunded by its depositor. This can be executed as a deliberate attack on the protocol: when a malicious actor deposits a whitelisted NFT token and refunds it in the next block.
## Vulnerability Detail
The [DepositManagerV1.fundBountyNFT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L113) function allows anyone to deposit NFT tokens as bounty rewards, but only for the three bounty contracts: `AtomicBountyV1`, `TieredPercentageBountyV1`, and `TieredFixedBountyV1`. When depositing an NFT to one of the contracts, the information about the deposit is recorded:
```solidity
funder[depositId] = _sender;
tokenAddress[depositId] = _tokenAddress;
depositTime[depositId] = block.timestamp;
tokenId[depositId] = _tokenId;
expiration[depositId] = _expiration;
isNFT[depositId] = true;

deposits.push(depositId);
nftDeposits.push(depositId);
```

The `nftDeposits` state variable stores all IDs of NFT deposits. It's used to get the list of all deposited NFTs when bounty winners claim their rewards:
1. [for atomic bounties](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/ClaimManager/Implementations/ClaimManagerV1.sol#L150-L151);
1. [for tiered percentage bounties](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/ClaimManager/Implementations/ClaimManagerV1.sol#L251-L254);
1. [for tiered fixed bounties](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/ClaimManager/Implementations/ClaimManagerV1.sol#L320-L323).

The [DepositManagerV1.refundDeposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L152) function allows depositors to withdraw deposited ERC20 and NFT tokens [after the deposits have expires](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L163-L167). The subsequent [BountyCore.refundDeposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L64) call [transfers an NFT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L81-L85) from the bounty contract to its depositor. However, refunded NTFs are not excluded from the `nftDeposits` state variable, which is iterated during claiming. As a result, when claiming an NFT that has been refunded, there will be a revert because the contract won't be the owner of the NFT.

This allows a malicious actor to block reward claiming in any bounty contract of one of the three types. Consider this exploit scenario:
1. A bounty contract is funded with valid ERC20 tokens.
1. A malicious actor transfers a whitelisted NFT to the bounty contract and sets the `expiration` argument to 1 second.
1. The malicious actor withdraws their NFT in the next block.
1. A bounty winner of the bounty contract calls the `ClaimManagerV1.claimBounty` function. The contract tries to claim the NFT deposited by the malicious actor and reverts because it's not longer the owner of the token.
1. Bounty winners of the bounty contracts cannot claim their rewards becaus the `ClaimManagerV1.claimBounty` function always reverts.
## Impact
Users cannot claim rewards in `AtomicBountyV1`, `TieredPercentageBountyV1`, and `TieredFixedBountyV1` bounty contracts after a deposited NFT was withdrawn by its depositor.

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
In the three claim bounty functions, consider adding a check that skips the call to the `BountyCore.claimNft` function if the NFT was refunded.
