# `__ERC721Holder_init()` is not called in all the bounty contracts

## Summary

All the bounty contracts inherit `ERC721HolderUpgradeable`. But none of them call `__ERC721Holder_init()` in `initialize()`. 

https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/utils/ERC721HolderUpgradeable.sol#L16

## Vulnerability Detail

All the bounty contracts inherit `ERC721HolderUpgradeable`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Storage/BountyStorageCore.sol#L27
```solidity
abstract contract BountyStorageCore is
    IBountyCore,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable,
    ERC721HolderUpgradeable,
    OnlyOpenQ,
    ClaimManagerOwnable,
    DepositManagerOwnable
```

Then `__ERC721Holder_init()` should be called in `initialize()`. 

## Impact

Even if `__ERC721Holder_init()` does nothing for now. but it could be different in the future. It is better to call `__ERC721Holder_init()` in `initialize()`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add  `__ERC721Holder_init()` in `initialize()` of all the bounty contracts.
