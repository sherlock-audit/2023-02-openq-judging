# Malicious or hacked issuer can update the payout address token and volume and block developer rewards

## Summary

In Ongoing as well as TieredFix bounties, a malicious or hacked issuer can update the payout token address and the payout volume which can reduce trust from the developers because they might not get paid for a feature they developed or they can be paid less than expected depending on the issuer will. Because of that, in my opinion, this contract is not totally acting as an escrow anymore because as a developer I would still need to trust the issuer (likely one person) to not maliciously update the token address and not decrease the volume.

## Vulnerability Detail

At multiple places an issuer can update the token address to be used for making the payments as well as the volume.

```solidity
function setPayout(address _payoutTokenAddress, uint256 _payoutVolume)
        external
        onlyOpenQ
    {
        payoutTokenAddress = _payoutTokenAddress; <====================================================
        payoutVolume = _payoutVolume;
    }
```

```solidity
function setFundingGoal(address _fundingToken, uint256 _fundingGoal)
        external
        override
        onlyOpenQ
    {
        fundingGoal = _fundingGoal;
        fundingToken = _fundingToken;
        hasFundingGoal = true;

        payoutTokenAddress = _fundingToken; <====================================================
    }
```

```solidity
function setPayoutScheduleFixed(
        uint256[] calldata _payoutSchedule,
        address _payoutTokenAddress
    ) external onlyOpenQ {
        require(
            bountyType == OpenQDefinitions.TIERED_FIXED,
            Errors.NOT_A_FIXED_TIERED_BOUNTY
        );
        payoutSchedule = _payoutSchedule;
        payoutTokenAddress = _payoutTokenAddress;  <====================================================

        // Resize metadata arrays and copy current members to new array
        // NOTE: If resizing to fewer tiers than previously, the final indexes will be removed
        string[] memory newTierWinners = new string[](payoutSchedule.length);
        bool[] memory newInvoiceComplete = new bool[](payoutSchedule.length);
        bool[] memory newSupportingDocumentsCompleted = new bool[](
            payoutSchedule.length
        );

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tierWinners.length; i++) {
            newTierWinners[i] = tierWinners[i];
        }
        tierWinners = newTierWinners;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < invoiceComplete.length; i++) {
            newInvoiceComplete[i] = invoiceComplete[i];
        }
        invoiceComplete = newInvoiceComplete;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < supportingDocumentsComplete.length; i++) {
            newSupportingDocumentsCompleted[i] = supportingDocumentsComplete[i];
        }
        supportingDocumentsComplete = newSupportingDocumentsCompleted;
    }
```

I think it has been implemented like that to easily manage the payments in one token at one point and another token later on. Also, changing the volume would allow to increase or reduce the payouts dynamically depending on affluence.

However, by implementing this I tend to think that we lose the main properties of the blockchain (because we end up trusting one person or at least one EOA which might be any user willing to see the feature implemented) and in my opinion this can easily be solved by creating a new bounty for each of the couples (token address, volume). However, it might have impacts in terms of user experience, I don't know.

## Impact

Developers might not completely trust the escrow because the trust might likely be reduced to one person (the issuer). This can disincentivize the developers to use the platform because they might end up in a situation where they invested few hours of their time for winning let say 1000 USDC and they end up getting paid, if even paid, 500 USDC for instance depending on the decision of the issuer.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Create one Ongoing and TieredFix bounty per (token address, volume) for a given issue and not be able to change it. If the funds need to be migrated from one bounty to another, the funders can still get back their funds by refunding and send them back to the new contract but at least the dev can trust that those guarantees won't change overtime.
