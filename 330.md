# Steal All Rewards From A Tiered Percentage Bounty

## Summary

Because the token reward for a tiered bounty is a percentage of the funding at the close of competition, a malicious actor can temporarily bloat the funding totals right before close, withdraw rewards they were granted at a multiple of what they should be getting, then refund the tokens used to bloat the funding total.

This can be done by any user who received any reward from a tiered percentage bounty and results in them being able to easily steal all rewards from the contract. 


## Vulnerability Detail

1. Win any tier in a tiered percentage bounty (example: 10% of tokens).
2. Right before close, deposit 10x the current token balance with a 1 second expiry.
3. After close, withdraw your reward which will now be 100% of the original balance.
4. After withdrawal, refund the deposited tokens.
5. You've now stolen the entire pot.

## Impact
Critical, allows someone to steal all funds.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/TieredPercentageBountyV1.sol#L134 Funding totals being decided right at time of competition close while a user can still refund their deposit.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either force a certain length of expiry and/or disallow refunds after a competition has closed.
