# BountyCore.receiveFunds() fails to verify that the token funded is the ``_payoutTokenAddress`` required by the issuer of the bounty

## Summary
``BountyCore.receiveFunds()`` fails to verify that the token funded is the ``_payoutTokenAddress`` required by the issuer of the bounty.

## Vulnerability Detail
``BountyCore.receiveFunds()`` does not check that the token funded is the ``_payoutTokenAddress`` required by the issuer of the bounty. As a result, the deposit manager might deposit different kinds of tokens.
