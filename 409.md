# TokenDepositReceived, NFTDepositReceived, DepositRefunded, DepositExtended emit bountyType always ATOMIC type of bounty

## Summary

TokenDepositReceived, NFTDepositReceived, DepositRefunded, DepositExtended emit bountyType always ATOMIC type of bounty

## Vulnerability Detail

Event might seems like a not important factor in audit because it doesn't change state. But, if there is an off-chain mechanism, which automatically parse input from Event, this may lead to an issue. 

OpenQ is using some kind of off-chain mechanism, for example the `oracle` which is hosted on OZ defender, and OpenQ also mentioned on their docs page, their stack https://docs.openq.dev/cool-nerd-stuff/technical-overview#the-openq-stack, saying: 
> `A subgraph from [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/) indexing all Events surrounding bounties` 

There are code which contains a wrongly emitted events which possible to became an issues:

- TokenDepositReceived
- NFTDepositReceived
- DepositRefunded
- DepositExtended

current implementation will always emitting event as Atomic Bounty, because the emit always return `0` for the `bountyType` field, which is the Atomic Bounty type.

193:             VERSION_1
194:         );
```


## Impact

Any off-chain script scanning for those events can be wrongly parsed / interpreted, and indexing from TheGraph can also wrongly parsed which could lead to serious issues when something like an accounting app uses this data.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend emitting the correct event, for example, using the `bounty.bountyType()` when emitting the event, not the `0`.
