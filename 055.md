# Funds can be frozen in the contract without the possibility of refund or claiming

## Summary
This is a combination of two attack vectors outlined in H-1 and H-2. When performed in synchrony they can prevent `funder` from getting a refund and a claimant from claiming his rewards. Ultimately leading to funds being stuck in the contract forever.

## Vulnerability Detail
If we take into consideration [H-1 - Funds can be frozen due to refunding functionality DOS](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq-youngDuckling/issues/1) and  [H-2 - Malicious token can be used to fund bounty and prevent claiming of funds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq-youngDuckling/issues/2) together, we can come to the conclusion that an attacker performing both of these attacks simultaneously can cause the funds to be locked in the bounty forever with neither party (or any third party) being able to rescue them.

H-1:
"Attacker could submit many 1 wei deposits with the same token to DOS the refund functionality.
This would create many `depositId`s.

When a` funder` calls `refundDeposit()` the function will revert because `bounty.getLockedFunds()` will have to iterate through all `depositId` and end up running out of gas."

H-2:
"As long as the `tokenAddressLimitReached` hasn't been reached any token that is not whitelisted can be used to fund a bounty. An attacker can use this to fund a bounty with a token that reverts when a user tries claiming their funds after completing a job. This would prevent the claimant from receiving all the other non-malicious tokens that the bounty was also funded with."

## Impact
Funds frozen forever.
