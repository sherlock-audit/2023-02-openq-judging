# `DepositManagerV1` can be initialized without a proxy

## Summary

`DepositManagerV1` can be initialized without a proxy

## Vulnerability Detail

`DepositManagerV1` is meant to be initialized through the `OpenQProxy`. The `initialize()` function should therefore include the `onlyProxy` modifier to ensure this is only done through a proxy.

```solidity
    function initialize() external initializer {
        __Ownable_init();
        __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
    }
```

Use of `onlyProxy` will check that the execution is being performed through a delegatecall call and that the execution context is a proxy contract with an implementation (as defined in ERC1967) pointing to self (https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy).

Notice that the other functions in the contract such as `fundBountyToken` have correctly implemented the `onlyProxy` modifier.

## Impact

It is possible for `DepositManagerV1` to be initialized without going through a proxy which would break functionality of deposits as only a proxy can call the various other functions in the contract.
