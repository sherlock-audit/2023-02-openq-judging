# Can prevent NFT deposits by depositing then refunding NFTs

## Summary

Because refunded NFT deposits count toward the `nftDepositLimit`, it is possible to deny issuers the ability to deposit NFTs by repeatedly depositing and refunding a single NFT until the limit is reached.

Even without refunding, the same can be done with low-value NFTs from a whitelisted address.

## Vulnerability Detail

Someone may repeatedly call `DepositManager.fundBountyNFT` and `DepositManager.refundDeposit` to grow the `nftDeposits` array in a bounty until it reaches `nftDepositLimit` (currently 5)

## Impact

Griefers can prevent bounties from being funded with NFTs. They can potentially do this after the bounty is funded with tokens, meaning issuers will need to create two bounties for the same issue in order to give the intended reward.

## Code Snippet

The various `receiveNft` implementations, e.g.: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/AtomicBountyV1.sol#L125 , contain this snippet.

```solidity
        require(
            nftDeposits.length < nftDepositLimit,
            Errors.NFT_DEPOSIT_LIMIT_REACHED
        );
```

`nftDeposits` is grown within the same function. It is never shrunk.

```solidity
nftDeposits.push(depositId);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Either prevent non-issuers from doing deposits, or replace refunded NFT deposits with the last entry so as to shrink the NFT deposit array.
