# ClaimManagerV1: bountyIsClaimable function returns wrong result for TieredFixedBounty and TieredPercentageBounty

## Summary
The `ClaimManagerV1.bountyIsClaimable` function returns whether a bounty contract is claimable, i.e. whether payouts can be made from it.

For any of the four bounty types, the `bountyIsClaimable` function returns `true`, indicating that the bounty is claimable, when the bounty is in the `OPEN` state.

This is correct for `AtomicBounty` and `OngoingBounty`.

But it is not correct for `TieredFixedBounty` and `TieredPercentageBounty`.

## Vulnerability Detail
`ClaimManagerV1.bountyIsClaimable` function looks like this:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/ClaimManager/Implementations/ClaimManagerV1.sol#L345-L365

So for all four bounty types it returns `true` if `status == 0`. The status `0` is the `OPEN` state.

However by looking at the `ClaimManagerV1` contract it is obvious that `TieredFixedBounty` and `TieredPercentageBounty` are claimable even in the `CLOSED` state. For them the `CLOSED` state just means that the competition is closed and e.g. no more funding can occur.

## Impact
`ClaimManagerV1.bountyIsClaimable` function returns an incorrect result which can cause any components using this function to misbehave.

## Recommendation
