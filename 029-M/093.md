# bountyIsClaimable() returns incorrect result for unidentified bounty types

## Summary

`ClaimManagerV1.bountyIsClaimable()` is supposed to return true  for open bounties and false for closed ones. However, for new bounty types that are not one of the known 4, it will do the opposite.

## Vulnerability Detail

See Summary.

## Impact

This function is never called from another contract, and the else branch will never execute until new contract types are introduced. It could mess up off-chain code in the future.

## Code Snippet

From https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/ClaimManager/Implementations/ClaimManagerV1.sol#L345

```solidity
        if (
            _bountyType == OpenQDefinitions.ATOMIC ||
            _bountyType == OpenQDefinitions.ONGOING ||
            _bountyType == OpenQDefinitions.TIERED_PERCENTAGE ||
            _bountyType == OpenQDefinitions.TIERED_FIXED
        ) {
            return status == 0;
        } else {
            return status == 1;
        }
```

The else branch should presumably be `return false`.


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Removed use of magic numbers. Fix else branch to `return false` or remove branch entirely.
