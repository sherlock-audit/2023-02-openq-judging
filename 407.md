# Tiered Percentage bounty owners can cheat contributors out of payout

## Summary

Owners of a TieredPercentageBountyV1 can front-run calls to claimTier with their own calls to setPayoutSchedule, thereby cheating contributors out of a bounty.

(Note: I believe this attack is out of scope according to the contest instructions. I asked for clarification on Feb 9th and never got a response. I am writing these up hastily to put a stake in the ground. If it turns out that these are in-scope despite the rules suggesting otherwise, but this write-up is rejected because it was hastily written because the protocol owners never responded to my DM, I WILL cry foul.)

## Vulnerability Detail

See Summary. Note that setPayoutSchedule can add new tiers and assign the entire payout to new, unwon tiers.

## Impact

Bounty owners can cheat contributors
