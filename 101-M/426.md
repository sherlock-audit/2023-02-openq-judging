# A lower ranking tier can receive a higher amount than a higher ranking tier

## Summary
Considering that tiers are ordinal, i.e. tier 1 > tier 2 > tier 3 etc..., bounties awarded for a higher ranked tier should **always** be higher than the lower ranked ones but it is currently not the case.

## Vulnerability Detail
`setPayoutSchedule()` is used to set payout schedule. It sets the percentage of total bounty each tier is entitled to. It however does not check and ensure that a higher ranker tier receives a higher percentage than a lower ranked one.

Payout schedule is initially set in `constructor()` and the same check should be done here as well.

## Impact
The winner of a bounty of tier 1 can receive a lower amount than winner of tier 2 bounty, which is not what we want.

## Recommendation
Consider enforcing that the higher ranked tiers always receive a bigger bounty.
