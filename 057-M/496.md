# APPROVE THE `BountyCore` CONTRACT TO TRANSFER THE NFT FROM THE `_sender` TO ITS OWN CONTRACT

## Summary

Need to approve the `BountyCore` contract to transfer the NFT from the `_sender` address to it's own contract `(address(this))`. But here the `SafeTransferFrom` is called on the `IERC721Upgradeable` nft without approving the `BountyCore` contract to `SafeTransferFom`.

## Vulnerability Detail

When we call the `SafeTransferFrom` on the `ERC721Upgradeable` nft, the `BountyCore` contract should be approved by the owner of the NFT to conduct the transfer of the NFT succesfully. But here the NFT is not approved by the owner for the `BountyCore`. Hence the `safeTransferFrom` transaction can fail in run time.

## Impact

Since the `ERC721Upgradeable` NFT is not approved by the owner for the `BountyCore` contract the `SafeTransferFrom` transacton could fail in runtime.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function _receiveNft(
        address _tokenAddress,
        address _sender,
        uint256 _tokenId
    ) internal virtual {
        IERC721Upgradeable nft = IERC721Upgradeable(_tokenAddress); 
        nft.safeTransferFrom(_sender, address(this), _tokenId);
    }
```

## Tool used

VS Code and Manual Review

## Recommendation

Owner must approve the `ERC721Upgradeable` NFT  for the `BountyCore` contract before the `safeTransferFrom` transaction can be executed. Make sure to conduct the approve functionality prior to the transfer `_receiveNft()` function
