# token Limit is not enforced when adding a new token

## Summary
Currently in `TokenWhitelist` there is functioanlity to add and remove tokens from the tokenWhitelist. whenever a token gets added the state variable `tokenCount` increments and when a token gets removed it decrements. It is my understanding that this varuable is supposed to be used to enforce a limit on the number of tokens whitelisted. However there is no check to see if the to be added token will go over a limit. This will lead to broken functonality and deviation from the intention of the protocol.  

## Vulnerability Detail
See above 

    /// @notice Adds tokenAddress to the whitelist
    /// @param _tokenAddress The token address to add to the whitelist
    function addToken(address _tokenAddress) external onlyOwner {
        require(
            !this.isWhitelisted(_tokenAddress),
            Errors.TOKEN_ALREADY_WHITELISTED
        );
        whitelist[_tokenAddress] = true;
        tokenCount++;
    }

## Recommendation

Implement check for that utilizes teh tokenCount variable when addig a new token to the whitelist.
