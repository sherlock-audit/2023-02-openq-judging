# Early bounty contracts can be bricked.

## Summary
`bountyFactory`, `claimManager` and `depositManager` addresses are not defined upon initialization which will cause bricked bounty contracts to potentially be deployed.

## Vulnerability Detail
When `OpenQV1` contract is initialized it doesn't give default value to `bountyFactory`, `claimManager` and `depositManager`:

[OpenQV1.sol#L14-L18](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/OpenQ/Implementations/OpenQV1.sol#L14-L18)
```solidity
    function initialize() external initializer onlyProxy {
        __Ownable_init();
        __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
        __ReentrancyGuard_init();
    }
```

Instead it uses 3 functions, `setBountyFactory`, `setClaimManager` and `setDepositManager` to separately initialize these variables.

If `setBountyFactory` is called first, contracts with `claimManager == address(0)` and `depositManager == address(0)` could be deployed.
A bounty contract deployed under these conditions will be unusable because the `DepositManagerV1` and `ClaimManagerV1` contracts are essential to its functioning.

## Impact

A state of the contract allow for deployment of unusable contracts. Waste of deployment gas.

## Code Snippet

[OpenQV1.sol#L36-L43](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/OpenQ/Implementations/OpenQV1.sol#L36-L43)
```solidity
        address bountyAddress = bountyFactory.mintBounty(
            _bountyId,
            msg.sender,
            _organization,
            claimManager,
            depositManager,
            _initOperation
        );
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend to deploy default versions of `BountyFactory`, `DepositManagerV1` and `ClaimManagerV1` first and then initialize `OpenQV1` with the addresses of these default contracts.
