# sinh3ck - Closing `TierFixedBounty` May Lock Tokens In Bounty Forever

## Summary

Bounties of type `TieredFixedBounty` can be closed with leftover tokens which may be lost forever.

## Vulnerability Detail

A bounty of type `TierFixedBounty` contains a variable named `_payoutSchedule` that is used during the claiming of the tier of the bounty. If the funded amount is greater than what is specified in `_payoutSchedule`, claims on the bounty will never fully drain the bounty of the specific `_payoutTokenAddress`. When the bounty is closed by the issuer (with `closeCompetition()`), leftover tokens will be lost forever.

## Impact

Tokens may be lost forever if `TierFixedBounty` is closed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to assert that a `TIER_FIXED` bounty initialized with a specific `_payoutSchedule` can only be closed when all the tokens have been drained. Another possible solution is to assert each funding of the bounty at maximum what is indicated in `_payoutSchedule`.
