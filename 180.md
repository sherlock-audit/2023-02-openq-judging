# bountyIsOpen::_bountyAddress requires some additional validation to ensure that the input received is a valid address

## Summary
bountyIsOpen calls from fundBountyNFT function,fundBountyToken. If the input is incorrect or the received address does not point to the correct contract, then this function may generate an error and cause the contract to exhaust gas or encounter other errors. Therefore, it is very important to perform validation before calling

## Vulnerability Detail
Summary

## Impact
the address `_bountyAddress` is still open and accessible. If bountyIsOpen returns false, however, note that this validation only ensures that the bounty is still open and does not handle any other errors that may occur during the process. 
``` solidity
    function bountyIsOpen(address _bountyAddress) public view returns (bool) {
        IBounty bounty = IBounty(payable(_bountyAddress));
        bool isOpen = bounty.status() == OpenQDefinitions.OPEN;
        return isOpen;
    }
```

## Code Snippet
``` solidity
DepositManager\Implementations\DepositManagerV1.sol
222:     function bountyIsOpen(address _bountyAddress) public view returns (bool) {
223:         IBounty bounty = IBounty(payable(_bountyAddress));
224:         bool isOpen = bounty.status() == OpenQDefinitions.OPEN;
225:         return isOpen;
226:     }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add to ensure that _bountyAddress is a valid address and point to the correct contract that _bountyAddress is not 0, which means the address is invalid.
