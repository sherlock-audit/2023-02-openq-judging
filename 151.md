# ``getSupportingDocumentsComplete()`` might return ``claimIds`` who have actually not completed their supporting documents

## Summary
``getSupportingDocumentsComplete()`` might return ``claimIds`` who have actually not completed their supporting documents.

## Vulnerability Detail
``getSupportingDocumentsComplete()`` might return ``claimIds`` who have actually not completed their supporting documents because ``setSupportingDocumentsComplete()`` will push the ``_claimID`` to the list even when ``_supportingDocumentsComplete == false``.

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/OngoingBountyV1.sol#L188-L198](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/OngoingBountyV1.sol#L188-L198)

As a result, ``getSupportingDocumentsComplete()`` will return a list ``claimIds`` including some that have not actually completed their supporting documents. 

```javascript
function getSupportingDocumentsComplete()
        external
        view
        returns (bytes memory)
    {
        return abi.encode(supportingDocumentsCompleteClaimIds);
    }
```
## Impact
``getSupportingDocumentsComplete()`` will return a list ``claimIds`` including some that have not actually completed their supporting documents.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Only push the ``_claimId`` only when ``_supportingDocumentsComplete == true``.
```diff
function setSupportingDocumentsComplete(bytes calldata _data)
        external
        onlyOpenQ
    {
        (bytes32 _claimId, bool _supportingDocumentsComplete) = abi.decode(
            _data,
            (bytes32, bool)
        );
        supportingDocumentsComplete[_claimId] = _supportingDocumentsComplete;
+     if( _supportingDocumentsComplete)
                 supportingDocumentsCompleteClaimIds.push(_claimId);
    }
```
