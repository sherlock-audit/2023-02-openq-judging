# Claims can be stopped by triggerring out-of-gas errors

## Summary
The contract `ClaimManagerV1` handles claims and processes them through the `claimBounty()` function. However, this function runs an unbounded for loop which can be made large to cause an out-of-gas error. This prevents claims from being processed.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the contract `ClaimManagerV1`, the function `claimBounty()` handles the claims. It does some checks and then delegates the claims to a different function based on the type of the bounty contract,

Some of these function (`_claimAtomicBounty` and `_claimTieredPercentageBounty`) run for loops over the array `_bounty.getTokenAddresses()`.

This array is unbounded, since the function `receiveFunds()` responsible for processing deposits in the bounty contracts have no hard limit set for them. This array can be made sufficiently large to cause out-of-gas errors and disable the claiming mechanism.
## Impact
Disables the claiming mechanism

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Put a check on the length of the array `tokenAddresses` in the `receiveFunds()` function in `BountyCore.sol`.
