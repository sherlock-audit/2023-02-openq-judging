# `OpenQV1.solvent` always reverts for tiered bounties

## Summary
Calling the `OpenQV1.solvent` function and specified the bounty ID of a tiered bounty will always revert. Users and integration won't be able to check if a tiered bounty has enough funds to cover payouts.
## Vulnerability Detail
As per the documentation of the [OpenQV1.solvent](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/OpenQ/Implementations/OpenQV1.sol#L408) function:
> Determines whether or not an ongoing bounty or tiered bounty have enough funds to cover payouts

The function calls these functions on a bounty contract:
- `payoutTokenAddress`;
- `getTokenBalance`;
- `payoutVolume`.

However, the `payoutVolume` function is only implemented in the [OngoingBountyV1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/OngoingBountyV1.sol#L11) contract, not in [TieredFixedBountyV1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/TieredFixedBountyV1.sol#L11) or [TieredPercentageBountyV1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/TieredPercentageBountyV1.sol#L10).
## Impact
The bug doesn't allow to check solvency of tiered bounty contracts. As a result, users, third-party integrations, and off-chain analytic services won't be able to check if tiered bounties have enough funds to cover payouts. Not able to see insolvent bounties may put users at an increased risk.
