# not support token: revert on Zero Value Transfers.

## Summary
Some token will revert when transfer 0,  claimBounty()  will fail

## Vulnerability Detail

Openq is committed to supporting more token, as written in the document:

```solidity
DEPLOYMENT: polygon mainnet
LANGUAGE: solidity 0.8.17
ERC20: any
ERC721: any
ERC777: any
FEE-ON-TRANSFER: any
REBASING TOKENS: any
ADMIN: restricted for upgrades, trusted for other admin functionality described below
EXTERNAL-ADMINS: oracle, claimManager, depositManager, openQ, issuer/minter of a bounty
```
But the current implementation does not support: Revert on Zero Value Transfers.

https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20/#revert-on-zero-value-transfers

The current transfer token code is implemented as follows:

```solidity
    function _transferERC20(
        address _tokenAddress,
        address _payoutAddress,
        uint256 _volume
    ) internal virtual {
        IERC20Upgradeable token = IERC20Upgradeable(_tokenAddress);
        token.safeTransfer(_payoutAddress, _volume);  //@audit <--------some token like: LEND ,when _volume ==0 will revert
    }
```

When will there be a transfer quantity equal to 0?

The most common situation is:
1. When the deposit is refunded, the token address still exists in the "tokenAddresses" array, so _bounty.claimBalance () will still be executed, but the balance is 0 at this time.
2. Type is TIERED_PERCENTAGE, and the total bonus is too small. After rounding, the bonus due is 0.

All of the above have been attacked by malicious users, such as depositing a token with a quantity of 1, or refunding it immediately after depositing it.

If this type of token is supported, malicious user attacks will cause users to fail in claims forever.


Suggestion when _volume ==0, don't perform transfer.

## Impact

If this kind of token support is added, it will be attacked, resulting in failure to claim bounty

## Recommendation

```solidity
    function _transferERC20(
        address _tokenAddress,
        address _payoutAddress,
        uint256 _volume
    ) internal virtual {
+      if (_volume==0) return;
        IERC20Upgradeable token = IERC20Upgradeable(_tokenAddress);
        token.safeTransfer(_payoutAddress, _volume);  //@audit <--------some token like: LEND ,when _volume ==0 will revert
    }
```
