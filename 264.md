# Adversary can block NFT distribution on tiered bounties by assigning the NFTs to unused tiers

## Summary

Bounties limit the number of NFT deposits to five. An adversary can block adding NFTs by assigning NFTs to tiers that don't exist.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L113-L131

DepositMangerV1#fundBountyNFT passes the user supplied _data to TieredBountyCore#receiveNft

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/TieredBountyCore.sol#L41-L42

_data is decoded and stored in _tier allowing the user to specify any tier they wish.

An adversary can abuse this fill all eligible nft deposit slots with nfts that can't be claimed by any tier. This allows them to effectively disable nft prizes for any tiered bounty. Using a large enough tier will make it impossible to ever claim the nfts because it would cost too much gas to set a large enough payout schedule

## Impact

Adversary can effectively disable nft prizes for any tiered bounty

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

TieredBountyCore#receiveNFT should check that specified tier is a within bound (i.e. by comparing it to the length of tierWinners)
