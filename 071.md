# Token may stuck forever in percentage bounty that apply to more than 1 token address

## Summary
The token may be stuck forever in a percentage bounty that applies to more than 1 token address

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's say a percentage bounty fund with

token A = 600
token B = 300
token C = 100

And payout schedule is 60, 30, 10

Payout 1 = 60 / 100 * 600 =  360 token A
Payout 2 = 30 / 100 * 300 = 90 token B
Payout 3 = 10 / 100 * 100 =  10 token C

The next claim for payout 1 is 360 again and the protocol will reject it as there is insufficient fund as there is only 240 left (600 - 240)

Added a test unit to TieredPercentageBounty.js

```solidity
it.only('should transfer volume of tokenAddress balance based on payoutSchedule', async () => {
	// ARRANGE
	const [, firstPlace, secondPlace] = await ethers.getSigners();

	await tieredContract.connect(depositManager).receiveFunds(owner.address, mockLink.address, 600, Constants.thirtyDays); // 600
	await tieredContract.connect(depositManager).receiveFunds(owner.address, mockDai.address, 300, Constants.thirtyDays); // 300

	{
		const firstPlaceTokenBalance = (await mockLink.balanceOf(firstPlace.address)).toString();
		expect(firstPlaceTokenBalance).to.equal('0'); // user has 0 LINK

		const bountyMockTokenBalance = (await mockLink.balanceOf(tieredContract.address)).toString();
		expect(bountyMockTokenBalance).to.equal('600'); // contract has 600 Link
	}

	const deposits = await tieredContract.getDeposits();
	const linkDepositId = deposits[0];

	await tieredContract.connect(claimManager).closeCompetition();

	await tieredContract.connect(claimManager).claimTiered(firstPlace.address, 0, mockLink.address);

	{
		const firstPlaceTokenBalance = (await mockLink.balanceOf(firstPlace.address)).toString();
		expect(firstPlaceTokenBalance).to.equal('360'); // user has 360 LINK

		const bountyMockTokenBalance = (await mockLink.balanceOf(tieredContract.address)).toString();
		expect(bountyMockTokenBalance).to.equal('240'); // contract has 240 LINK
	}

	await expect(tieredContract.connect(claimManager).claimTiered(firstPlace.address, 0, mockLink.address)).to.be.revertedWith('ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance'); // Unable to transfer
});
```
## Impact
Token A may be stuck in the percentage bounty contract forever

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
There are several ways to solve this problem. What I would suggest is allowing the owner to transfer out the excessive protocol token and ERC20 token that could be locked in the contract
