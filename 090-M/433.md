# [M-03] When claiming Tiered Fixed bounty, if the total funding are less than total payout in payout schedule, some wining participant will not receive fund

## Summary

When claiming Tiered Fixed bounty, if the total funding are less than total payout in payout schedule, some wining participant will not receive fund. It will create a front-run competition, who claim faster will get the tier prize, who claim slower will get nothing even though the slower may be the one who get top prize.

## Vulnerability Details

When claiming tiered fixed bounty, the function `claimTieredFixed` does not check if the total fund is sufficient to cover all the tiered prize. A bounty could have sufficient fund in the first place but when the competition is closed, the depositor may withdraw the fund.

It leads to the situation that who claim faster will get the prize. The slowed claimant cannot withdraw and lose the assets.

## Impact

Participant can lose the prized assets if claiming slow.
