# claimer not supporting ERC-721 tokens can be DOS

## Summary
Anyone can prevent a claimer not supporting ERC-721 from claiming.

## Vulnerability Detail
`_claimAtomicBounty` loops through the ERC20 token deposits, then through the NFT deposits to send the reward

```solidity
File: contracts/ClaimManager/Implementations/ClaimManagerV1.sol
150:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < _bounty.getNftDeposits().length; i++) {
151:             _bounty.claimNft(_closer, _bounty.nftDeposits(i)); 
```

This transfers the NFT to the claimer using a `safeTransferFrom` call.

```solidity
File: contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol
257:     function _transferNft(
258:         address _tokenAddress,
259:         address _payoutAddress,
260:         uint256 _tokenId
261:     ) internal virtual {
262:         IERC721Upgradeable nft = IERC721Upgradeable(_tokenAddress);
263:         nft.safeTransferFrom(address(this), _payoutAddress, _tokenId);
264:     }
```

The issue is that the `safeTransferFrom` call reverts if the `_payoutAddress` does not support ERC721 tokens.

It means a claimer call can be DOS by front-running them with a `fundBountyNFT()` call, adding a NFT reward to the bounty, which will make the claimer unable to claim.

## Impact
Valid claimer is unable to claim their ERC20 token rewards.
It is likely that bounty issuers will specify the token the reward will be in.
Claimer could be using a smart wallet that does not support ERC-721 token, and seeing a bounty paying in `MATIC` (or any ERC20 token), would participate in the bounty. In such case, the attack would prevent them from claiming.

## Recommendation
Consider using a `try/catch` approach for claiming.
