# mintBounty is vulnerable to frontrunning

## Summary

mintBounty is vulnerable to frontrunning

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation, when minting a bounty, the user requires to supplies the bounty id

```solidity
function mintBounty(
	string calldata _bountyId,
	string calldata _organization,
	OpenQDefinitions.InitOperation memory _initOperation
) external nonReentrant onlyProxy returns (address) {
	require(
		bountyIdToAddress[_bountyId] == address(0),
		Errors.BOUNTY_ALREADY_EXISTS
	);

	address bountyAddress = bountyFactory.mintBounty(
		_bountyId,
		msg.sender,
		_organization,
		claimManager,
		depositManager,
		_initOperation
	);
```

The code above enforce the uniqueness of the bountyId,

however, the code is very vulnerable to front-running. The bountyid may generate off-line and have speical meaning to the organization, for example, the organization use the bountyId to track the project bounty version, 

An adversary can monitor the mempool in pool, for example, by using service like blocknative.

And the adversary can front-run the mintBounty transaction to take over the bounty id.

The original mintBounty transaction revert because the unique bounty id is taken.

## Impact

The original mintBounty transaction revert because the unique bounty id is taken. and an adversary take over a unique bounty id.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol generate a bounty id for user once a bounty is deployed to avoid such front-running issue.
