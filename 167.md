# DDoS attack on unbound ````deposits```` array

## Summary
The ````deposits```` array of ````BountyStorageCore```` contract is unbound, along with the ````for```` loop read in ````getLockedFunds()```` function which is called by ````refundDeposit()````, lead to a realistic DDoS attack vector which would prevent any users from ````refund````.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's illustrate why DDoS attack  is realistic and feasible.
As shown on [L54](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Storage/BountyStorageCore.sol#L54) of ````BountyStorageCore```` contract and [L34~L36](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L34-L36) of ````receiveFunds()```` function
```solidity
    function receiveFunds(
        // ...
    )
        // ...
    {
        require(_volume != 0, Errors.ZERO_VOLUME_SENT);
        require(_expiration > 0, Errors.EXPIRATION_NOT_GREATER_THAN_ZERO);
        require(status == OpenQDefinitions.OPEN, Errors.CONTRACT_IS_CLOSED);

        //...

        deposits.push(depositId);
        //...
    }
```
There is no limit on the ````deposits```` array length.

Next let's look at the  ````for```` loop in ````getLockedFunds()```` function, [L341-349](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L341~L349) of ````BountyCore```` contract
```solidity
    function getLockedFunds(address _depositId)
        // ...
    {
        uint256 lockedFunds;
        bytes32[] memory depList = this.getDeposits();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < depList.length; i++) {
            if (
                block.timestamp <
                depositTime[depList[i]] + expiration[depList[i]] && // @audit 2 SLOAD required
                tokenAddress[depList[i]] == _depositId // @audit 1 SLOAD required
            ) {
                lockedFunds += volume[depList[i]]; // @audit 1 SLOAD
            }
        }

        return lockedFunds;
    }
```
Each time an ````deposits```` item is added, there is 4 additional  ````SLOAD```` instructions overhead. As one ````SLOAD```` costs [2100 gas](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2929#abstract), so each ````deposits```` item costs more than 8400 additional gas to call ````getLockedFunds()```` function. As the max gas limit of block is [30M](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/#block-size), we can calculate the minimum DDoS ````deposits```` by
```solidity
minDDoSDeposits = 30M / 8400 = 3572
```
So if there is more than 3572 deposits, then any transactions containing call to ````getLockedFunds()```` can't be mined. It looks like a big number, but the contract will be deployed on Polygon chain, the gas cost for executing one deposit is only about $0.02 ([reference](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xd1d6a19d3f3d8243b6cd3954be621c2ff4fc5a5a6b3184a8712016de48a1dadd)). As depositing ````volume```` of token can be as low as 1 WEI, the total cost for a successful DDoS attack is pretty much the total gas cost which is about
```solidity
costOfDDoSAttack = 3572 * $0.02 = $71.44 
```
We can see the cost is low, so the attack is realistic and feasible.

## Impact
The attack would prevent any users from ````refund````
