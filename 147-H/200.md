# Lack of usage and enforcement for fundingGoalToken and funding volume, developer can claim very minimal bounty if claim early or close the competition early

## Summary

Lack of usage and enforcement for fundingGoalToken and funding volume

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation of the OpenQ contract, the bounty issuer can set the fundingGoal.

```solidity
/// @notice Sets fundingGoal for bounty with id _bountyId
/// @param _bountyId The id to update
/// @param _fundingGoalToken The token address to be used for the funding goal
/// @param _fundingGoalVolume The volume of token to be used for the funding goal
function setFundingGoal(
    string calldata _bountyId,
    address _fundingGoalToken,
    uint256 _fundingGoalVolume
) external onlyProxy {
    IBounty bounty = getBounty(_bountyId);

    require(msg.sender == bounty.issuer(), Errors.CALLER_NOT_ISSUER);

    bounty.setFundingGoal(_fundingGoalToken, _fundingGoalVolume);

    emit FundingGoalSet(
        address(bounty),
        _fundingGoalToken,
        _fundingGoalVolume,
        bounty.bountyType(),
        new bytes(0),
        VERSION_1
    );
}
```

which calls:

```solidity
/// @notice Sets the funding goal
/// @param _fundingToken Token address for funding goal
/// @param _fundingGoal Token volume for funding goal
function setFundingGoal(address _fundingToken, uint256 _fundingGoal)
    external
    virtual
    onlyOpenQ
{
    fundingGoal = _fundingGoal;
    fundingToken = _fundingToken;
    hasFundingGoal = true;
}
```

However, this fundingGoal volume and fundingToken is only used in the read-only view function.

```solidity
bool public hasFundingGoal;
address public fundingToken;
uint256 public fundingGoal;
```

The fundingToken and funding goal volume is not used validate that when user wants to fund the bounty contract via DepositManager.sol and before the bounty is closed.

The user should only be used the same fundingToken to fund the bounty contract, otherwise, the user can fund the bounty with worthless token and when the bounty is settled, the developer cannot really get valuable money.

The bounty should only be closed and user should be only allowed to claim the reward via the ClaimManager.sol once the fundingGoal is reached, which means someone fund the bounty contract to make sure the balance of token in the bounty contract exceeds the fundingGoal volume.

Otherwise, if the bounty is closed early, the developer may not claim the entitled bounty amount.

For example, once the _claimAtomicBounty is called, the code below executes:

```solidity
function _claimAtomicBounty(
        IAtomicBounty _bounty,
        address _closer,
        bytes calldata _closerData
    ) internal {
        _eligibleToClaimAtomicBounty(_bounty, _closer);

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _bounty.getTokenAddresses().length; i++) {
            uint256 volume = _bounty.claimBalance(
                _closer,
                _bounty.getTokenAddresses()[i]
            );

            emit TokenBalanceClaimed(
                _bounty.bountyId(),
                address(_bounty),
                _bounty.organization(),
                _closer,
                block.timestamp,
                _bounty.getTokenAddresses()[i],
                volume,
                _bounty.bountyType(),
                _closerData,
                VERSION_1
            );
        }

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _bounty.getNftDeposits().length; i++) {
            _bounty.claimNft(_closer, _bounty.nftDeposits(i));

            emit NFTClaimed(
                _bounty.bountyId(),
                address(_bounty),
                _bounty.organization(),
                _closer,
                block.timestamp,
                _bounty.tokenAddress(_bounty.nftDeposits(i)),
                _bounty.tokenId(_bounty.nftDeposits(i)),
                _bounty.bountyType(),
                _closerData,
                VERSION_1
            );
        }
    }
```

The code above really does not check if the funding goal volume is met, either though there is no one fund the bounty contract, the transaction can go through and the developer claims 0 bounty

because  _bounty.getTokenAddresses().length is 0 and _bounty.getNftDeposits().length

Or For example, if the funding goal volume is 1000 USDC, meaning the 1000 USDC is expected to be funded into the bounty contract, but in fact, only 500 USDC is funded so far, and at this point the bounty is claimed, the developer is only able to claim 500 USDC instead of 1000 USDC if the developer claim the bounty early before 1000 USDC is funded.

The TieredFixedBounty will also be impacted due to lack of check of the funding goal volume, when _claimTieredFixedBounty is called, the code executes:

```solidity
function _claimTieredFixedBounty(
        IBounty _bounty,
        address _closer,
        bytes calldata _closerData
    ) internal {
        (, , , , uint256 _tier) = abi.decode(
            _closerData,
            (address, string, address, string, uint256)
        );

        _eligibleToClaimTier(_bounty, _tier, _closer);

        if (_bounty.status() == 0) {
            _bounty.closeCompetition();

            emit BountyClosed(
                _bounty.bountyId(),
                address(_bounty),
                _bounty.organization(),
                address(0),
                block.timestamp,
                _bounty.bountyType(),
                new bytes(0),
                VERSION_1
            );
        }
```

which calls _bounty.closeCompetition

```solidity
/// @notice Similar to close() for single priced bounties. closeCompetition() freezes the current funds for the competition.
function closeCompetition() external onlyClaimManager {
    require(
        status == OpenQDefinitions.OPEN,
        Errors.CONTRACT_ALREADY_CLOSED
    );

    status = OpenQDefinitions.CLOSED;
    bountyClosedTime = block.timestamp;

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < getTokenAddresses().length; i++) {
        address _tokenAddress = getTokenAddresses()[i];
        fundingTotals[_tokenAddress] = getTokenBalance(_tokenAddress);
    }
}
```

note the code: fundingTotals[_tokenAddress] = getTokenBalance(_tokenAddress) which take a snapsot of the current token balance in the bounty contract, which is used to calculate how many tokens can be claimed for each tiers.

```solidity
function claimTiered(
        address _payoutAddress,
        uint256 _tier,
        address _tokenAddress
    ) external onlyClaimManager nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
        require(
            bountyType == OpenQDefinitions.TIERED_PERCENTAGE,
            Errors.NOT_A_TIERED_BOUNTY
        );
        require(!tierClaimed[_tier], Errors.TIER_ALREADY_CLAIMED);

        uint256 claimedBalance = (payoutSchedule[_tier] *
            fundingTotals[_tokenAddress]) / 100;

        _transferToken(_tokenAddress, claimedBalance, _payoutAddress);
        return claimedBalance;
    }
```

note the code:

```solidity
  uint256 claimedBalance = (payoutSchedule[_tier] *
      fundingTotals[_tokenAddress]) / 100;
```

For example, the funding goal volume is set to 15000 USDC, and there are three tiers. Tier1 is expected to claim 50% of the 15000 USDC token, tier 2 is expected to claim 30% of the 15000 USDC and tier 3 is expected to claim 20% of the 15000 USDC.

However, because the funding goal volume is not checked and there may be not enough token funded to the bounty contract, the closeCompetition is called early when there is only 1000 USDC in the bounty contract, the tier1 and tier 2 and tier3 developer has to share the 50%, and 30% and 20% of the 1000 USDC and developers are severely under-paid.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Make sure the user can only fund the bounty contract if the token used matches the funding token and make sure only close the bounty and let the developer claim once the token balance funded in the contract equal or exceed the funding goal volume.

I also want to highlight that the current implement allows user to fund the contract using NFT but it is not clear how the on-chain contract determine the value of the NFT to check if the supplied NFT reach the funding goal volume.
