# The NFT deposit limit may be not enough for tiered bounties

## Summary
The number of tiers is not limited in the tiered bounty contracts, however no more than 5 NFT tokens can be deposited to a bounty contract. As a result, bounty minters cannot run bounty programs that have more than 5 tiers and that award winners with NFTs.
## Vulnerability Detail
When initializing a tiered bounty contract, the [maximal number of NFT tokens tha can be funded is set to 5](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/TieredPercentageBountyV1.sol#L48), without allowing the minter to change the number. A tiered bounty contract [cannot receive more than the 5 NFT tokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/TieredBountyCore.sol#L25-L28). However, the number of tiers in a bounty program is [not limited](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/TieredBountyCore.sol#L59-L64).
## Impact
Bounty minters cannot use the protocol to run bounty programs with more than 5 tiers that award winners with NFT tokens.

## Recommendation
In the tiered bounty contracts, consider letting bounty minters decide the deposit limit of NFT tokens.
