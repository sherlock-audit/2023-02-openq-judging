# Protocol cannot handle rebasing tokens

## Summary
The documentation mentions that the protocol can handle all types of ERC20 tokens, including rebasing tokens. However, rebasing tokens can cause problems in the way refunds are calculated.
## Vulnerability Detail
Rebasing/elastic tokens are ERC20 tokens whose balance in a contract can change without any transfers involved, through periodic mints and burns. Thus the amount recorded when a deposit was made, might not be all be there when a refund is being called. An example is the Ampleforth token (AMPL), where every 24 hours tokens are minted/burned from every wallet to keeps its price close to $1. 

In the bounty contracts, funds received are stored in a `volume[bytes32]` mapping, and the user has claim to the same amount of tokens when triggering a refund. However, due to the burn and mint mechanisms, the funds in the contract can be different and might not be able to cover all user's refunds, leading to loss of tokens of late refunders.
## Impact
Loss of tokens during refund process
## Code Snippet
Here we see the volume mapping being set

and then being used without being changed when calculating the locked amount of funds
