# TieredFixedBountyV1#setPayoutScheduleFixed is intended to be able to resize to fewer tiers but can't

## Summary

It is intended that TieredFixedBountyV1#setPayoutScheduleFixed is able to reduce the number of available tiers for a bounty, but doing so will cause an out-of-bound error.

## Vulnerability Detail

Comments above code block indicate that it should be possible to resize to fewer tiers than before. This however is not the case. Since it use the length of the old array for the number of iterations of the loop to transfer the data it will cause an out-of-bounds error to be thrown when trying to transfer the final elements of the array. 

## Impact

Setting the payout won't work as intended
