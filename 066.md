# DepositManagerV1.refundDeposit will revert when big number of deposits will be created in bounty

## Summary
DepositManagerV1.refundDeposit will revert when big number of deposits will be created in bounty. This is because BountyCore.getLockedFunds will revert with out of gas error. As result it will be not possible to refund deposit.
## Vulnerability Detail
When depositor creates new deposit, then it is added to the [deposit array](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L54).
It's possible that the bounty contract will contain a lot of different deposits, so the number will increase with time.

In order to refund deposit, user calls `DepositManagerV1.refundDeposit`. This function will then [call `bounty.getLockedFunds`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L172) in order to receive locked tokens amount.

```solidity
    function getLockedFunds(address _depositId)
        public
        view
        virtual
        returns (uint256)
    {
        uint256 lockedFunds;
        bytes32[] memory depList = this.getDeposits();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < depList.length; i++) {
            if (
                block.timestamp <
                depositTime[depList[i]] + expiration[depList[i]] &&
                tokenAddress[depList[i]] == _depositId
            ) {
                lockedFunds += volume[depList[i]];
            }
        }


        return lockedFunds;
    }
```

As you can see, this function iterates over all deposits array and in case if it's too big, then it will just revert with out of gas error.

Also pls, note that anyone can create new deposit with 0 amount, so it allows to create a lot of deposits in order to prevent depositor from refunding if it's needed.
## Impact
It will be not possible to refund deposit.

## Recommendation
Add some deposit limit amount to the bounty, or think about another way to get deposits in specific token.
