# Refunds after close can trick the claims

## Summary

It is possible to mess up the accounting of tiered percentage bounty by refunding after the competition is closed.

## Vulnerability Detail

Tiered percentage bounty calculates the `fundingTotals` when closing the bounty:
```solidity
    function closeCompetition() external onlyClaimManager {
        ...
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < getTokenAddresses().length; i++) {
            address _tokenAddress = getTokenAddresses()[i];
            fundingTotals[_tokenAddress] = getTokenBalance(_tokenAddress);
        }
    }
```

Later  `fundingTotals` is used when calculating the claim amount:
```solidity
    function claimTiered(
        address _payoutAddress,
        uint256 _tier,
        address _tokenAddress
    ) external onlyClaimManager nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
        ...
        uint256 claimedBalance = (payoutSchedule[_tier] *
            fundingTotals[_tokenAddress]) / 100;
        ...
    }
```

The problem is that it is possible to refund even after the competition is closed:
```solidity
    function refundDeposit(address _bountyAddress, bytes32 _depositId)
        external
        onlyProxy
    {
        IBounty bounty = IBounty(payable(_bountyAddress));

        require(
            bounty.funder(_depositId) == msg.sender,
            Errors.CALLER_NOT_FUNDER
        );

        require(
            block.timestamp >=
                bounty.depositTime(_depositId) + bounty.expiration(_depositId),
            Errors.PREMATURE_REFUND_REQUEST
        );

        address depToken = bounty.tokenAddress(_depositId);

        uint256 availableFunds = bounty.getTokenBalance(depToken) -
            bounty.getLockedFunds(depToken);

        uint256 volume;
        if (bounty.volume(_depositId) <= availableFunds) {
            volume = bounty.volume(_depositId);
        } else {
            volume = availableFunds;
        }

        bounty.refundDeposit(_depositId, msg.sender, volume);
```

There are many possibilities for grief. For instance, block all the claims by adding a huge deposit and then refunding, making the balance insufficient to cover the claims. A more sophisticated vector could be to sandwich the `closeCompetition` with just enough funds for one of the winners to claim the whole pot and then refund leaving other participants with nothing.

## Impact

A malicious actor can insert their funds just before the closing of the competition and instantly refund afterward. The amount can be adjusted to make significant damage to the claim process, either by blocking it or extracting value on behalf of others.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 Possibly could calculate the `fundingTotals` on the go when claiming or preventing refunds (for some time?) when the competition is closed.
