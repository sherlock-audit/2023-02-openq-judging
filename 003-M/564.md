# `setPayoutScheduleFixed` and `setPayoutSchedule` are not using the correct array length value in the  `for` loop

## Summary

Contracts `TieredFixedBountyV1.sol` and `TieredPercentageBountyV1.sol` are having the functions `setPayoutScheduleFixed` and `setPayoutSchedule` to update the following new data. The function is called to resize the old data such that it could be less than the actual value.

        string[] memory newTierWinners = new string[](payoutSchedule.length);
        bool[] memory newInvoiceComplete = new bool[](payoutSchedule.length);
        bool[] memory newSupportingDocumentsCompleted = new bool[](
            payoutSchedule.length
        );

above arrays are allocated memory of `payoutSchedule.length`. 

The function `setPayoutScheduleFixed` does not checks that the `payoutSchedule.length < tierWinners.length`

So there are chances that the payoutSchedule.length could be greater than or lesser than the tierWinners.length;

    function setPayoutScheduleFixed(
        uint256[] calldata _payoutSchedule,
        address _payoutTokenAddress
    ) external onlyOpenQ {
        require(
            bountyType == OpenQDefinitions.TIERED_FIXED,
            Errors.NOT_A_FIXED_TIERED_BOUNTY
        );
        payoutSchedule = _payoutSchedule;
        payoutTokenAddress = _payoutTokenAddress;


        // Resize metadata arrays and copy current members to new array
        // NOTE: If resizing to fewer tiers than previously, the final indexes will be removed
        string[] memory newTierWinners = new string[](payoutSchedule.length);
        bool[] memory newInvoiceComplete = new bool[](payoutSchedule.length);
        bool[] memory newSupportingDocumentsCompleted = new bool[](
            payoutSchedule.length
        );


        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tierWinners.length; i++) {
            newTierWinners[i] = tierWinners[i];
        }
        tierWinners = newTierWinners;


        for (uint256 i = 0; i < invoiceComplete.length; i++) {
            newInvoiceComplete[i] = invoiceComplete[i];
        }
        invoiceComplete = newInvoiceComplete;


        for (uint256 i = 0; i < supportingDocumentsComplete.length; i++) {
            newSupportingDocumentsCompleted[i] = supportingDocumentsComplete[i];
        }
        supportingDocumentsComplete = newSupportingDocumentsCompleted;
    }


I see from  the function logic that the `setPayoutScheduleFixed` is used to resize (reduce the size of the data)

when `payoutSchedule.length` is lesser than the `tierWinners.length` the allocated memory is lesser than the original data(tierWinners.length).

But the code tries to insert the value in the memory unallocated array slot.

in one case, `payoutSchedule.length < tierWinners.length`, but the below code tries to traverse original value and tries to insert in the `newTierWinners`

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tierWinners.length; i++) {
            newTierWinners[i] = tierWinners[i];
        }
        tierWinners = newTierWinners;


        for (uint256 i = 0; i < invoiceComplete.length; i++) {
            newInvoiceComplete[i] = invoiceComplete[i];
        }
        invoiceComplete = newInvoiceComplete;


        for (uint256 i = 0; i < supportingDocumentsComplete.length; i++) {
            newSupportingDocumentsCompleted[i] = supportingDocumentsComplete[i];
        }
        supportingDocumentsComplete = newSupportingDocumentsCompleted;

## Vulnerability Detail

Refer the summary section.

## Impact

1. Access to memory unallocated array slot could result in unexpected output. Resizing can not be done
2. Loss of gas due to extra traversal of array.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The for loop traversal need to be based on the `newTierWinners.length` or `payoutSchedule.length`

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tierWinners.length; i++) {
            newTierWinners[i] = tierWinners[i];
        }
        tierWinners = newTierWinners;


        for (uint256 i = 0; i < invoiceComplete.length; i++) {
            newInvoiceComplete[i] = invoiceComplete[i];
        }
        invoiceComplete = newInvoiceComplete;


        for (uint256 i = 0; i < supportingDocumentsComplete.length; i++) {
            newSupportingDocumentsCompleted[i] = supportingDocumentsComplete[i];
        }

Similar issue can happen in the `TieredPercentageBountyV1.sol - setPayoutSchedule` also. Kinldy update the code there too.
