# A rogue deposited ERC-20 token can break the payouts

## Summary

There is an asymmetry on how we treat ERC-20 and NFT when they are blacklisted. In the case of ERC-20 they are still accepted as deposit but blacklisted NFT are not even accepted. However, the fact that any erc-20 gets accepted might lead to a situation where the distribution of the payouts might be impossible.

## Vulnerability Detail

We can add any erc-20 token as long t

```solidity
function fundBountyToken(
        address _bountyAddress,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _volume,
        uint256 _expiration,
        string memory funderUuid
    ) external payable onlyProxy {
        IBounty bounty = IBounty(payable(_bountyAddress));

        if (!isWhitelisted(_tokenAddress)) {
            require(
                !tokenAddressLimitReached(_bountyAddress),  <===================== we can add blacklisted tokens as long as the limit is not reached.
                Errors.TOO_MANY_TOKEN_ADDRESSES
            );
        }
```

This is different for NFTs as we can see below

```solidity
function fundBountyNFT(
        address _bountyAddress,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _tokenId,
        uint256 _expiration,
        bytes calldata _data
    ) external onlyProxy {
        IBounty bounty = IBounty(payable(_bountyAddress));

the pot?
        require(isWhitelisted(_tokenAddress), Errors.TOKEN_NOT_ACCEPTED); <=========================================
        require(bountyIsOpen(_bountyAddress), Errors.CONTRACT_ALREADY_CLOSED);

```

A possible attack would be a malicious user depositing some tokens with an ERC-20 token crafted for the occasion that just reverts on transfer.
In this case, since atomic bounty iterates over all token addresses and transfers the tokens one after the other to send the payouts, if there is one rogue token in the list, the transaction can revert and the payouts won't be made. Since there is no way to exclude any token from this loop (even the blacklisted ones), then the payouts are not possible anymore and the funds are not distributable.
This exploit alone might not totally lock the funds since the deposits can still be refunded but this attack combined with an attack on refund (like this one https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq-clems4ev3r/issues/2) could lock the funds since there is no other way for admins to recover them in case of emergency.

Here is the code that will revert if it iterates over a rogue token

```solidity
function _claimAtomicBounty(
        IAtomicBounty _bounty,
        address _closer,
        bytes calldata _closerData
    ) internal {
        _eligibleToClaimAtomicBounty(_bounty, _closer);

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _bounty.getTokenAddresses().length; i++) {
            uint256 volume = _bounty.claimBalance( <========================================== this will revert if `transfer` reverts by default on the rogue token.
                _closer,
                _bounty.getTokenAddresses()[i]
            );

            emit TokenBalanceClaimed(
                _bounty.bountyId(),
                address(_bounty),
                _bounty.organization(),
                _closer,
                block.timestamp,
                _bounty.getTokenAddresses()[i],
                volume,
                _bounty.bountyType(),
                _closerData,
                VERSION_1
            );
        }

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _bounty.getNftDeposits().length; i++) {
            _bounty.claimNft(_closer, _bounty.nftDeposits(i));

            emit NFTClaimed(
                _bounty.bountyId(),
                address(_bounty),
                _bounty.organization(),
                _closer,
                block.timestamp,
                _bounty.tokenAddress(_bounty.nftDeposits(i)),
                _bounty.tokenId(_bounty.nftDeposits(i)),
                _bounty.bountyType(),
                _closerData,
                VERSION_1
            );
        }
    }
```

This applies to all bounties where we iterate over the list of addresses, ie, atomic and both tiered bounties.

This can also be exploited in another way in TieredPercentageBounty. The malicious user can make a deposit of 2^256-1 of his rogue token and make the `claimTiered` function revert

```solidity
function claimTiered(
        address _payoutAddress,
        uint256 _tier,
        address _tokenAddress
    ) external onlyClaimManager nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
        require(
            bountyType == OpenQDefinitions.TIERED_PERCENTAGE,
            Errors.NOT_A_TIERED_BOUNTY
        );
        require(!tierClaimed[_tier], Errors.TIER_ALREADY_CLAIMED);

        uint256 claimedBalance = (payoutSchedule[_tier] * <================================ this will revert due to arithmetic overflow if fundingTotals is worth 2^256-1 and unless the schedule is 1.
            fundingTotals[_tokenAddress]) / 100;

        _transferToken(_tokenAddress, claimedBalance, _payoutAddress);
        return claimedBalance;
    }
```

## Impact

Any ERC-20 are accepted as funds as long as the number of token addresses do not exceeds the limit making it impossible to prevent the use of particular ERC-20 tokens and particularly it cannot be excluded from the distribution of the payouts. This has the effect of allowing an attack where a rogue token blocks all the payouts.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

* Why not simply disallow blacklisted tokens during deposit as it's done with NFTs?
* Make sure those tokens are skipped at claiming time in order to not lock the rest of the payouts. You can also have a function to distribute only one token at at time but this might need a deeper rework of the logic due to the various checks around the bounty status during claiming.
