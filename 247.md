# A non-whitelisted token can be deposited but a non-whitelisted NFT cannot

## Summary

There is an asymmetry on how we treat ERC-20 and NFT when they are blacklisted. In the case of ERC-20 they are still accepted as deposit but blacklisted NFT are not even accepted. This means that there is no mechanism to actually blacklist an ERC-20 token. It might still be a good thing to allow only the whitelisted tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
function fundBountyToken(
        address _bountyAddress,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _volume,
        uint256 _expiration,
        string memory funderUuid
    ) external payable onlyProxy {
        IBounty bounty = IBounty(payable(_bountyAddress));

        if (!isWhitelisted(_tokenAddress)) {
            require(
                !tokenAddressLimitReached(_bountyAddress),  <===================== we can add blacklisted tokens as long as the limit is not reached.
                Errors.TOO_MANY_TOKEN_ADDRESSES
            );
        }
```

This is different for NFTs as we can see below

```solidity
function fundBountyNFT(
        address _bountyAddress,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _tokenId,
        uint256 _expiration,
        bytes calldata _data
    ) external onlyProxy {
        IBounty bounty = IBounty(payable(_bountyAddress));

        // CMICHAUD: What if the token I use for funding was whitelisted and then blacklisted? Can I withdraw it? Can it count in the pot?
        require(isWhitelisted(_tokenAddress), Errors.TOKEN_NOT_ACCEPTED); <=========================================
        require(bountyIsOpen(_bountyAddress), Errors.CONTRACT_ALREADY_CLOSED);

```

## Impact

Any ERC-20 are accepted as funds as long as the number of token addresses do not exceeds the limit making it impossible to prevent the use of particular ERC-20 tokens.

Why not simply not allow non-whitelisted tokens?
