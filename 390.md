# Ongoing bounty can receive NFTs but can't send them to winners

## Summary
It is possible to fund ongoing bounties with NFTs, but they will be stuck on the contract as they are not transferred when bounty is claimed

## Vulnerability Detail
OngoingBountyV1 has a `receiveNft` method. It is possible to fund these bounties with NFTs. However, if we look at `claimOngoingPayout`, we see that it only works with ERC20 or protocol tokens.

## Impact
NFTs can get stuck on ongoing bounty contracts
