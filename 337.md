# Potential vulnerabilities of timestamp dependency

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L109

## Summary 
The blockchain's timestamp is vulnerable to manipulation by miners or other players, Someone may set it to a time in the future or past, thus causing deposit expiration dates to be erroneous.

## Vulnerability Detail
The block timestamp is used as a reference point to determine the deposit expiration time. But since someone can modify block timestamps, this could result in erroneous and potentially disastrous outcomes for the contract and its users.

## Impact
High

## Code Snippet
Manually Review

## Tool used
Manually Review

### Manual Review
Done

## Recommendation
To solve this issue, We can use the block's median timestamp, which is the median of a recent set of block timestamps and is considered to be more reliable than the individual block timestamps. 

```solidity
 uint256 medianTimestamp = block.timestamp.median();

        if (medianTimestamp > depositTime[_depositId] + expiration[_depositId]) {
            expiration[_depositId] = medianTimestamp - depositTime[_depositId] + _seconds;
        } else {
            expiration[_depositId] = expiration[_depositId] + _seconds;
        }

        return expiration[_depositId];
```
