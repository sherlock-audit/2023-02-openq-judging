# Possible loss of `msg.value` in the function `receiveFunds`

## Summary

The `receiveFunds` function in the BountyCore contract doesn't check that the `msg.value` is null in case of ERC20 tokens funding which could result in user losing ETH funds by accident and not being able to get refunded.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user wants to fund a bounty with a token (either ETH or ERC20) he must call the `fundBountyToken` function which internaly calls the `receiveFunds` function which allows both the ETH and ERC20 tokens transfers at the same time, so if a user that wants to fund the bounty with ERC20 tokens but also sends ETH in the form of `msg.value` in the same transaction (by accident), those fund will be lost as the `receiveFunds` function doesn't verify that `msg.value == 0` when performing an ERC20 tokens bounty funding and register only the ERC20 tokens deposited and the ETH amount will not be recorded.

The impact of this is that those ETH funds sent by accident will be locked in the Bounty contract and the user will not be able to get refunded.

## Impact

User can lose ETH funds by accident when funding a bounty contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To avoid this issue i recommend to add a check in the `receiveFunds` function to check that `msg.value == 0` in the case of an ERC20 tokens funding.
