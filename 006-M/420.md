# User can lose msg.value if they input wrong address.

## Summary

If a user accidentally sends native ETH to the receiveFunds function while not specifying address(0) as the _tokenAddress they can lose their funds. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The receiveFunds allows a user to either send native ETH or a whitelisted token to the contract, however if a user accidentally sends ETH with the _tokenAddress of one of the whitelisted tokens the [else block](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L45) will be triggered transferring the token to the protocol from the user while also receiving the ETH. 

## Impact

A user could lose any ETH that they send to the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check to confirm that that msg.value == 0 if the tokenAddress is not address(0).
