# Native / ERC20 tokens cannot be rescued if expiration is accidentally locked indefinitely

## Summary

Native / ERC20 tokens cannot be rescued if expiration is accidentally locked indefinitely.

## Vulnerability Detail

In DepositManager#fundBountyToken(), the parameter _expiration has no limits. A funder can accidentally set an expiration time that is indefinite (eg. >100 years).    
```solidity
    function fundBountyToken(
        address _bountyAddress,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _volume,
        uint256 _expiration,
        string memory funderUuid
    ) external payable onlyProxy {
```
Currently, there is only one way the funder can withdraw funded tokens, and that is to call refundDeposit. However, refundDeposit checks if block.timestamp is greater than deposit + expiration. If expiration is too high, then there is no way to rescue the tokens.

```solidity
        require(
            block.timestamp >= depositTime[_depositId] + expiration[_depositId],
            Errors.PREMATURE_REFUND_REQUEST
        );
```


## Impact

Tokens will be trapped indefinitely if expiration is passed in incorrectly.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Protocol owner should have a emergency function to rescue native / ERC20 tokens that are trapped in the contract. Recommendation is similar to this issue's recommendation:
