# funder can lose native token in `receiveFunds`

## Summary
Lack of sufficient checks in `receiveFunds` when transferring an `ERC20` token means a funder can lose native token if `msg.value` is mistakenly passed in the function call.

## Vulnerability Detail
`receiveFunds` allows a funder to transfer tokens to a bounty. It separates two cases: if funding is done with `MATIC`, and if it is done with `ERC20` tokens.

```solidity
File: contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol
41:         if (_tokenAddress == address(0)) {
42:             volumeReceived = msg.value;
43:         } else {
44:             volumeReceived = _receiveERC20(_tokenAddress, _funder, _volume);
45:         }
```

The issue is that in the ERC20 token branch (l44), it does not check `msg.value == 0`. If the funder mistakenly passed a non-zero `msg.value`, they will never be able to retrieve this amount.

## Impact
The funder loses that amount of `MATIC`.
Calling `refundDeposit` will not allow them to retrieve it, as the `tokenAddress[_depositId]` will be the `ERC20` token address, not address(0).
