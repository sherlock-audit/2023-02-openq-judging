# ongoing bounty issuer can deny some winners from claiming their funds by changing payment token or amount  after merging the pull request

## Summary
the prize for ongoing bounty winner are paid when off-chain oracle calls claim function for those bounty and winners and code would sent amount of token which are specified by bounty issuer to winner. the issuer can change amount or token after merging winner's PR and cause claim transaction to revert and deny winner from receiving the funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
This is `claimOngoingPayout()` code in OngoingBountyV1:
```solidity
    function claimOngoingPayout(
        address _payoutAddress,
        bytes calldata _closerData
    ) external onlyClaimManager nonReentrant returns (address, uint256) {
        (, string memory claimant, , string memory claimantAsset) = abi.decode(
            _closerData,
            (address, string, address, string)
        );

        bytes32 _claimId = generateClaimId(claimant, claimantAsset);

        claimId[_claimId] = true;
        claimIds.push(_claimId);

        _transferToken(payoutTokenAddress, payoutVolume, _payoutAddress);
        return (payoutTokenAddress, payoutVolume);
    }
```
As you can see code sends `payoutVolume` of `payoutTokenAddress` to winner's address. function `claimOngoingPayout()` is called only when oracle calls `ClaimManagerV1.claimBounty()`. bounty issuer can change bounty's `payoutVolume` and `payoutTokenAddress` by calling `OpenQV1.setPayout()` and use it to deny some winners from receiving their funds.
a malicious bounty issuer can perform this steps;
1. User1 would create ongoing Bounty1 and would transfer 100K USDT and set `payoutVolume` to be 10K and `payoutTokenAddress` to be USDT.
2. User2 would create a valid PR and User1 would merge the PR and oracle would call claim function for Bounty1 and User2 and code would transfer 10K USDT to User2.
3. then User3 and User4 create a valid PRs and User1 would merge their PRs but to avoid paying them rewards User1 would call `setPayout()` and change the `payoutVolume` to 1 in Bounty1.
4. now oracle would call claim function for Bounty1 and User3 and User4 and code would send them 1 USDT token.
5. so bounty issuer was able to change the payout amount after merging the PRs and deny some winners their funds.

## Impact
Winners can't receive their funds even after successful PRs. malicious bounty issuer can steal winners funds.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
code should freeze the value of `payoutTokenAddress` and `payoutAmount` after some time and won't allow issuer to change them anytime he wants.
