# Owner of Tiered bounties can frontrun the claim process by updating the payout schedule / winners

## Summary

Owner of Tiered bounties can frontrun the claim process by updating the payout schedule

## Vulnerability Detail

Both fixed and percentage tiered bounties allows the owner of the bounty to update the payout schedule via `setPayoutScheduleFixed` and `setPayoutSchedule`.

There is no time lock or restriction about the changes that an owner can make to the payout schedule, and it can be done multiple time.


Claiming a bounty happens via `ClaimManager` contract using two functions

- `claimBounty`
- `permissionedClaimTieredBounty`

Both functions perform the same checks and operations because internally they call `_claimTieredFixedBounty` or `_claimTieredPercentageBounty` but the `permissionedClaimTieredBounty` add these checks on top of those

- `closer` of the issue must have been added to the association list by the Oracle
- `closer` must have been added to the winner of the specific `tier` is going to claim


The owner of the bounty can call `TieredFixedBountyV1.setPayoutScheduleFixed` or `TieredPercentageBountyV1.setPayoutSchedule` (depending on the type of bounty) to update the payout schedule. There is no specific check on any timeframe or bounty status, so the owner can call this function whenever he/she wants (the only check done is for the percentage bounty where the sum must be equal to 100)

These functions allow the owner of the bounty to override these state variables

- `payoutSchedule`
- `payoutTokenAddress` (only fixed)
- `tierWinners`
- `invoiceComplete`
- `supportingDocumentsComplete`

The `payoutSchedule` is the state variable that determine the amount (in fixed volume or percentage) of reward the claimer will get
The `tierWinners` the state variables used by the `ClaimManagerV1.permissionedClaimTieredBounty` function to know if the claimer has won the tier

By overriding this information, the owner of the bounty could be able to frontrun the claimer or the oracle and

- Prevent the claimer to be able to claim the bounty by resetting the winner of the tier (`permissionedClaimTieredBounty` will revert)
- Change the amount (resetting to zero or lower compared to the original one) of rewards that the claimer would be able to get once claimed the bounty 

## Impact

Owner of the bounty could prevent the claimer to be able to claim the reward

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Some possible options

- Allow the owner of the bounty to change this information only if winners have not been set yet
- Add a time lock to the operation
- Allow the owner of the bounty to change this information only if X hours have not passed after the bounty creation

The basic idea is that the owner should not be able to frontrun the claim process
