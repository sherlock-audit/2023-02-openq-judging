# Attacker can fund bounty contract with multiple worthless ERC20 such that TOKEN_ADDRESS_LIMIT is reached

## Summary
A bounty contract can only be funded with a certain amount of different ERC20 tokens that are not in the `DepositMangerV1`'s whitelist.

It is checked in the `DepositManagerV1` contract if this amount has been reached:

This can be exploited.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the bounty is created the attacker can fund the bounty contract with so many different worthless ERC20 tokens that the limit is reached and no additional ERC20 tokens can be deposited.

## Impact
The attacker can DOS the funding functionality such that the ERC20 token limit is used up with useless tokens.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The bounty issuer should be able to specify a list of tokens that can be used for funding.
