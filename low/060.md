# No limit to expiration date could lead to frozen funds

## Summary
 `funder` might have his funds frozen for many years.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no boundaries for `_expiration` when funding a bounty. This might lead to an unreasonably long period (e.g 10 years) that the `funder` might have to wait to get his refund.

## Impact
`funder` will not be able to get a refund on his deposit.
