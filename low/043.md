# [Best practice] No constructors should be allowed in the upgradable contracts

## Summary
No constructors should be allowed in the upgradable contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail
In all the upgradable contracts, right now we can see the following code

```solidity
    constructor() {}
```    

We should remove it. 

As written in https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable, "Due to a requirement of the proxy-based upgradeability system, no constructors can be used in upgradeable contracts."

## Impact
We do not follow the best practice of Openzeppelin's upgradable contracts.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove all the empty constructors
