# Many deposits can block refunds

## Summary

Deposits are susceptible to the infamous loop gas limit issue leading to nonrefundable assets.

## Vulnerability Detail
Anyone can deposit funds supposedly the asset is whitelisted or the limit is not reached. However, every new deposit is pushed to the array as a new entry:
```solidity
    function receiveFunds(
        ...
    )
        ...
    {
        ...
        deposits.push(depositId);
        ...
    }
```
So the `deposits` is an unbounded array. The problem is that when refunding the assets, it needs to iterate over all the deposits and calculate the locked funds:
```solidity
    function refundDeposit(address _bountyAddress, bytes32 _depositId)
        external
        onlyProxy
    {
        ...
        uint256 availableFunds = bounty.getTokenBalance(depToken) -
            bounty.getLockedFunds(depToken);
```

```solidity
    function getLockedFunds(address _depositId)
        public
        view
        virtual
        returns (uint256)
    {
        uint256 lockedFunds;
        bytes32[] memory depList = this.getDeposits();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < depList.length; i++) {
            if (
                block.timestamp <
                depositTime[depList[i]] + expiration[depList[i]] &&
                tokenAddress[depList[i]] == _depositId
            ) {
                lockedFunds += volume[depList[i]];
            }
        }

        return lockedFunds;
    }
}
```
A malicious actor can decide to fund the bounty with 100+ deposits of the smallest fraction of whitelisted assets to block other refunds.

## Impact

The `deposits` array might grow too large not fitting in one block and thus blocking the refunds. Anyone can exploit this because there are no restrictions on how many deposits or who can deposit. For example, a participant can exploit this to ensure the funds are locked forever.

## Recommendation
Consider refactoring `getLockedFunds` to track `lockedFunds` on deposit/refund actions and just return the cached value with no dynamic iterations.
