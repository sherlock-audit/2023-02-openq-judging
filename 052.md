# Funds can be frozen due to refunding functionality DOS

## Summary

There is no limit to the amount of deposits that can be made to a bounty. This could lead to a DOS when trying to get a refund, essentially freezing the funds forever.

## Vulnerability Detail
Attacker could submit many 1 wei deposits with the same token to DOS the refund functionality.
This would create many `depositId`s.

When a `funder` calls `refundDeposit()` the function will revert because `bounty.getLockedFunds()` will have to iterate through all `depositId` and end up running out of gas.

## Impact
No `funder` would be able to claim a refund and the funds would be forever frozen.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Have a universal minimum bounty funding amount so creating many `depositId` becomes expensive.
AND/OR
Have a limit to the number of `depositId` per bounty.
