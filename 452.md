# Disable initializers

## Summary
It is recommended to apply ```_disableInitializers``` in the constructor of â€‹`UUPSUpgradeable` contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail

There are a few contracts that use the UUPS pattern but do not take the extra precaution to disable the initializers, e.g.:
```solidity
contract ClaimManagerV1 is ClaimManagerStorageV1 {
    constructor() {}
```

Citing https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/is-disableinitializers-necessary/31070/2:
    "There was a previous UUPS vulnerability where if an implementation contract was initialized by an attacker,
     the attacker could give themselves upgrade authority and delegate a call to a malicious contract that causes the implementation
      contract to self destruct. That vulnerability was resolved by restricting the upgrade functions to onlyProxy,
      but disabling initializers is still recommended as an extra layer of protection against these types of attacks."

## Impact

The likelihood of exploitation is probably low, and this acts as an extra layer of protection thus I have it a 'Low' severity.
