# Locked funds calculation is invalid if part of the deposit was claimed

## Summary
If part of the deposit was claimed, `getLockedFunds` calculation in `BountyCore` is invalid which may lead to errors when trying to refund a deposit

## Vulnerability Detail
In `getLockedFunds` locked funds are calculated the following way:
```solidity
    lockedFunds += volume[depList[i]];
```
Using `volume[depList[i]]` means always taking full deposit amount. However, if some of the rewards were claimed, then only the remaining portion of the deposit should be considered locked. This can lead to errors as shown in the PoC for ongoing bounty:
- Deposit 100 DAI with expiration = 50
- Deposit 50 DAI with expiration = 1
- Rewind 10 seconds forward so that second deposit is expired
- Claim a bounty (70 DAI)
- Attempt to refund second deposit of 50 DAI
- Despite the fact that contract has enough DAI, this will revert due to the error in locked funds calculation

## Impact
Under certain circumstances depositor will not be able to refund an expired deposit

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Subtract the amount of claimed tokens when calculating locked funds. Amount of claimed tokens can be tracked separately
