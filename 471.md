# initialize() function of ERC1967Proxy can be frontrun

## Summary
The ERC1967Proxy `OpenQProxy` deployment and `initialize()` is not atomic. The `initialize()` transaction can be frontrun by attacker to take full control of `OpenQV1`, `ClaimManagerV1 `and `DepositManagerV1`.

## Vulnerability Detail
`OpenQV1`, `ClaimManagerV1 `and `DepositManagerV1` are all `ERC1967Proxy`s. The proxy contract deployment and initialziation are 2 separate transactions.

The comments of OpenQProxy tell that the `_data` is empty which indicate that `initialize()` is not called at deployment time.

The deploy code demonstrates this actions which includes these two separate transactions.

The attacker can monitor the blockchain and look for the proxy deployment transaction and frontrun with a malicious initialize() transaction. The malicious initialize will make the attacker the owner of the contract. Since they are all `UUPSUpgradeable`, attacker can further upgrade with malicious contracts.

## Impact
Attacker can take full ownership of `OpenQV1`, `ClaimManagerV1 `and `DepositManagerV1`, and take further actions to steal funds.

## Code Snippet
Deployment code of `OpenQV1`, `ClaimManagerV1 `and `DepositManagerV1` are all affected.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Deploy and initialize() OpenQProxy within one transaction. That is passing `initialize()`'s signature as _data parameter of OpenQProxy's constractor.
