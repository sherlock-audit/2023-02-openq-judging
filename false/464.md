# openQ sync among contracts

## Summary

Different related contracts might rely on different versions of `openQ` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
Claim manager allows changing the address pointing to the `openQ` contract:
```solidity
    function setOpenQ(address _openQ) external onlyProxy onlyOwner {
        openQ = _openQ;
    }
```
However, other contracts that also rely on `openQ`, e.g. bounties do not allow changes after the initialization.

## Impact

If `openQ` is changed in the Claim manager, this might lead to out-of-sync and coordination issues with old bounties that use another instance of this contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
One possible solution is to allow updates of the `openQ` in old the beacon bounties. Another solution is to forbid changing the address everywhere once initialized because all the contracts are upgradable anyway.
