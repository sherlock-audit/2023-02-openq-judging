# NFT transfer could be lost if the receiver contract does not implement onerc721received

## Summary

In BountyCore.sol, the `_transferNft()` function uses `safeTransferFrom` to handle NFT transfer. However, if the `_payoutAddress` is a contract without implementing `onerc721received` callback, the NFT would be locked.


## Vulnerability Detail

Imagine, some Tiered Percentage Bounty has 2 payouts tokens, USDC and DAI. And the tier 3 for USDC and DAI are 20%, the bounty has 1000 USDC and 800 DAI respectively in balance. If the claim 


## Impact

`safeTransferFrom` will revert if the receiver contract does not have `onerc721received` callback. And the BountyCore.sol doest not provide option to specify payout address. If the bounty is initiated from a contract but without `onerc721received` hooker, the NFT payout could not be received nor refunded.
