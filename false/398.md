# There is no cap for the `total funded amount` for a bounty contract, which results in that a funder may wastefully spend extra gas fee

## Summary
There is no cap for the **total funded amount** for a bounty contract.
As a result, funding tokens for a bounty contract will be continued even if the **total funded amount** for a bounty contract would be reached the `fundingGoal` set. 
This lead to a bad situation that a funder (OpenQ Proxy) may wastefully spend extra gas fee that doesn't need (to spend) if the funder attempt to fund much larger amount of tokens than the `fundingGoal`.

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the BountyStorageCore, the `fundingGoal` is defined as a state variable:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Storage/BountyStorageCore.sol#L69
```solidity
    uint256 public fundingGoal;  /// @audit
```

Within the OpenQV1# `setFundingGoal()`, 
the BountyCore# `setFundingGoal()` is called to set the value to the `fundingGoal` state variable like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/OpenQ/Implementations/OpenQV1.sol#L126
```solidity
    function setFundingGoal(
        string calldata _bountyId,
        address _fundingGoalToken,
        uint256 _fundingGoalVolume
    ) external onlyProxy {
        IBounty bounty = getBounty(_bountyId);
        ...

        bounty.setFundingGoal(_fundingGoalToken, _fundingGoalVolume);  /// @audit
        ...
    }
```

Then, within the BountyCore# `setFundingGoal()` , 
the `_fundingGoal` assigned would be set to the `fundingGoal` state variable like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L146
```solidity
    function setFundingGoal(address _fundingToken, uint256 _fundingGoal)
        external
        virtual
        onlyOpenQ
    {
        fundingGoal = _fundingGoal;  /// @audit
        fundingToken = _fundingToken;
        hasFundingGoal = true;
    }
```

After that, within the DepositManagerV1# `fundBountyToken()`,
the BountyCore# `receiveFunds()` is called for funding ERC20 tokens for a bounty contract like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L54-L56
```solidity
    function fundBountyToken(
        address _bountyAddress,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _volume,
        uint256 _expiration,
        string memory funderUuid
    ) external payable onlyProxy {
        IBounty bounty = IBounty(payable(_bountyAddress));
        ...

        (bytes32 depositId, uint256 volumeReceived) = bounty.receiveFunds{  /// @audit
            value: msg.value
        }(msg.sender, _tokenAddress, _volume, _expiration);
        ...
    }
```

Then, within the BountyCore# `receiveFunds()`, tokens will be funded into a bounty contract by using `msg.value` or `_receiveERC20()` depends on the type of tokens (Native token or ERC20 token) like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L41-L45
```solidity
    function receiveFunds(
        address _funder,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _volume,
        uint256 _expiration
    )
        ...
        uint256 volumeReceived;
        if (_tokenAddress == address(0)) {
            volumeReceived = msg.value;
        } else {
            volumeReceived = _receiveERC20(_tokenAddress, _funder, _volume);
        }
        ...
```

However, despite the `fundingGoal` is set via the the OpenQV1# `setFundingGoal()` (and BountyCore# `setFundingGoal()`) above, it's not used in the DepositManagerV1# `fundBountyToken()` (and the BountyCore# `receiveFunds()`) above in order to check whether or not the **total funded amount** for a bounty contract already reaches the `fundingGoal`.ðŸ”µ

This means that there is no cap for the **total funded amount** for a bounty contract.
As a result, funding tokens for a bounty contract will be continued even if the **total funded amount** for a bounty contract would be reached the `fundingGoal` set. 
This lead to a bad situation that a funder (OpenQ Proxy) may wastefully spend extra gas fee that doesn't need (to spend) if the funder attempt to fund much larger amount of tokens than the `fundingGoal`.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a validation to check whether or not the **total funded amount** for a bounty contract would exceeds the `fundingGoal` set to the DepositManagerV1# `fundBountyToken()` like this:
```solidity
    function fundBountyToken(
        address _bountyAddress,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _volume,
        uint256 _expiration,
        string memory funderUuid
    ) external payable onlyProxy {
        IBounty bounty = IBounty(payable(_bountyAddress));
        
        uint256 currentTotalFundedAmount;
        if (_tokenAddress == address(0)) {
            currentTotalFundedAmount = address(payable(_bountyAddress)).balance;  /// @audit - In case of that a token address funded is a Native token (eg. ETH, MATIC)
        } else {
            currentTotalFundedAmount = IERC20(_tokenAddress).balanceOf(_bountyAddress); /// @audit - In case of that a token address funded is a ERC20 token
        }
        
        /// @audit - Here is a validation to check whether or not the total funded amount for a bounty contract would exceeds the fundingGoal set
        require(currentTotalFundedAmount + _volume <= fundingGoal, "Total funding amount exceeds the fundingGoal");
        ...
```
