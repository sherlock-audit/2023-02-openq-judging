# Contract initialization can be frontran.

## Summary

There is no faculty in OpenQ to deploy and initialize the main protocol contracts in one transaction. Instead they are deployed in one transaction and initialized in another. Attackers can frontrun the initialization transaction to initialize the contracts themselves. They would then be the protocol owner.

## Vulnerability Detail

The initialize functions are called in a separate transaction than the one in which the contracts are deployed. They are also unprotected. An attacker can frontrun the init transactions to become the contract owner.

## Recommendation

Add some sort of access control to the initializers, or create a factory to deploy and initialize the core protocol contracts in a single transaction.
