# `onlyProxy` modifiers are missing in two functions of `OpenQV1`



## Summary
`onlyProxy` modifiers are missing in `setTierWinner` and `closeOngoing`, so when users call these functions through other proxies by fault, they won't change actual states for active proxy.

## Vulnerability Detail
`OpenQV1.setTierWinner` and `OpenQV1.closeOngoing` don't have `onlyProxy` modifier. 

```solidity
    function setTierWinner(
        string calldata _bountyId,
        uint256 _tier,
        string calldata _winner
    ) external {
```

So `setTierWinner` doesn't check if current call is from active proxy and when users call this function through other proxy, it can be successful but it doesn't change actual states for tier winners. 
(UUPSUpgradeable.sol#L38-L42)
```solidity
    modifier onlyProxy() {
        require(address(this) != __self, "Function must be called through delegatecall");
        require(_getImplementation() == __self, "Function must be called through active proxy");
        _;
    }
```

So the `onlyProxy` modifier is mandatory for those two functions.

## Impact
Functions calls through other proxies won't change states of active proxy.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add `onlyProxy` modifier to `setTierWinner` and `closeOngoing` in `OpenQV1.sol`.
