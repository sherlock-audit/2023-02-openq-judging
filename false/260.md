# No checking for address.call() or delegatecall() reentrancy

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L31

## Summary
Although the code's "nonReentrant" modifier  prevents reentrancy by preventing a contract from calling itself recursively, but this modifier does not guard against "address.call()" or "delegatecall()" reentrancy attack.

## Vulnerability Detail
When someone's contract call this contract and call back into his contract and passes along any data and Ether that should be used in the execution, modifying this contract's state or stealing funds from this contract or leading to unexpected or harmful behavior.

## Recommendation
It is better to use the `transfer` function of the ERC20 contract instead of `call`. We know the `transfer ` function is atomic and ensures that the value is transferred without the possibility of reentrancy.
