# Accidental direct transfer of NFT will be frozen forever

## Summary

Accidentally received NFT will be lost forever. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Unlike ERC20, NFT has a callback mechanism. Specifically, when doing safeTransferFrom, it is transferred only after making sure that the recipient responds appropriately. Therefore, when an NFT is transferred directly to a non-response contract, it will basically fail. 
However, since these bounty contracts needs to receive NFT, it will send an appropriate response when doing safeTransferFrom.
Also, in the protocol, there is no function implemented to transfer an accidentally received NFT to its owner. This can cause the loss of NFTs. 

## Impact

Accidentally received NFTs can be lost forever.

## Code Snippet

The `BountyStorageCore` inherited `ERC721HolderUpgradeable`. The code is below: 
[BountyStorageCore.sol#L24-L31](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Storage/BountyStorageCore.sol#L24-L31)
```solidity
abstract contract BountyStorageCore is
    IBountyCore,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable,
    ERC721HolderUpgradeable,
    OnlyOpenQ,
    ClaimManagerOwnable,
    DepositManagerOwnable
{
```
This part of code in the `ERC721HolderUpgradeable` can be optimized to minimize the impact. See the Recommendation part below. 

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Contracts with `onERC721Recieved` should be overridden as shown below.
```solidity
    function onERC721Received(
        address operator,
        address,
        uint256,
        bytes memory
    ) public virtual override returns (bytes4) {
        require(operator == address(this), 'Cannot send NFT directly to bounty contract. Please use the BountyV1.receiveNFT() method.');
        return this.onERC721Received.selector;
    }
```
Then I found a typobounty.
`boutny` is supposed to be `bounty`.
