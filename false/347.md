# An attacker can disable all deposits

## Summary

The DepositManagerV1 contract is UUPSUpgradeable. However, unlike the other upgradeable contracts in OpenQ, its initializer is not protected with `onlyProxy`. Therefore, an attacker can init the logic contract directly, take ownership of it, and force it to delegatecall a contract containing a SELFDESTRUCT operation.

## Vulnerability Detail

The initializer in DepositManagerV1.sol is unprotected, unlike the other upgradeable contracts in OpenQ.

The deploy flow also does not call initialize on the logic contract, only the proxy.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/deploy/deploy_contracts.js#L93-L118

Because the logic contract is unprotected and uninitialized, an attacker can call `initialize()`, become the owner, and call `upgradeToAndCall()` which performs a delegatecall to an attacker-chosen address. The attacker can then SELFDESTRUCT the Deposit Manager logic contract. 

## Impact

All past and future deposits on the OpenQ platform are disabled. Because the deposit manager logic contract was destroyed, its proxy can no longer function or upgrade.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add `onlyProxy` to the deposit manager's initializer.
