# Validations

## Summary

The protocol lacks some essential validations to prevent common errors.

## Vulnerability Detail

1) When funding the bounty, it is possible to specify any `_expiration` value, e.g.:
```solidity
 function receiveNft(
        ...
    ) external override onlyDepositManager nonReentrant returns (bytes32) {
        ...
        require(_expiration > 0, Errors.EXPIRATION_NOT_GREATER_THAN_ZERO);
        ...
        expiration[depositId] = _expiration;
```
If the expiration is accidentally set to very far in the future, it might become practically impossible to refund it. Expiration should have a reasonable upper boundary, e.g. 2 years to prevent accidental lock of funds.

2) When funding the tokens, a limit cap is applied only to not whitelisted tokens:
```solidity
        if (!isWhitelisted(_tokenAddress)) {
            require(
                !tokenAddressLimitReached(_bountyAddress),
                Errors.TOO_MANY_TOKEN_ADDRESSES
            );
        }
```
The whitelist has no upper limit, meaning if too many tokens are added to the whitelist, anyone can block the bounties by funding tiny amounts of each whitelisted token making the iterations exceed the block gas limit. My suggestion is to have the upper limit for the whitelist and probably each whitelisted token should have a reasonable min amount configuration to prevent dust amounts from reaching the bounty.

3) There are certain functions that I suppose should be called only once, e.g.:
```solidity
    function setTierWinner(string memory _winner, uint256 _tier)
        external
        onlyOpenQ
    {
        tierWinners[_tier] = _winner;
    }
```
```solidity
    function setTierClaimed(uint256 _tier) external onlyClaimManager {
        tierClaimed[_tier] = true;
    }
```
It will override the old data and brick the bounty if the tier winner or claim is set again. Consider ensuring these and similar functions cannot be invoked repeatedly.

4) Not clear if intentional, but `extendDeposit` does not check if the bounty is open thus it is possible to extend the deposit of a closed bounty.

5) It would be better if the `OpenQ` contract called `generateClaimId` on the bounty contract when determining the `claimId` here:
```solidity
    function ongoingClaimed(
        string calldata _bountyId,
        string calldata _claimant,
        string calldata _claimantAsset
    ) external view returns (bool) {
        IBounty bounty = getBounty(_bountyId);
        bytes32 claimId = keccak256(abi.encode(_claimant, _claimantAsset));
```
Because if the bounty used some other algorithm to calculate this id, this would lead to messed up behavior.

6) `__OnlyOpenQ_init` probably lacks the `onlyInitializing` modifier:
```solidity
    function __OnlyOpenQ_init(address _initalOpenQ) internal {
        _openQ = _initalOpenQ;
    }
```

## Impact

While not likely, if any of these cases occur in practice, it could significantly hurt the system.
