# MALICIOUS USER CAN FRONT RUN THE `initialize()` FUNCTION IN THE `OpenQV1` AND BECOME THE OWNER OF THE CONTRACT

## Summary

`OpenQV1` is an UUPS Upgradeable contract. It's an implementation contract and expected to call via `OpenQProxy.sol`. But the `OpenQProxy.sol` in its constructor only defines the implementation contract address and dosen't pass in the `_data` field to initialize the `OpenQV1` `initialization()` function. (as per the following comment `an empty byte array in the case of OpenQ` given in the `OpenQProxy.sol` contract) . 

## Vulnerability Detail

Since the `initialization()` function of the `OpenQV1` is not called during contract deployment of `OpenQProxy.sol`, an external user will have to initialize the `OpenQV1` via  a delegateCall through the proxy contract. Hence any malicious user can front run this initialization delegateCall via the `OpenQProxy` and become the owner of the contract thus depriving the OpenQ protocol the opportunity to be the owner.

## Impact

A malicious user can be the owner of the `OpenQV1` implementation contract and following `onlyOwner` callable functions inside the `OpenQV1` contract will be vulnerable as a result.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    /// @param _data Additional data to pass to initialize method (an empty byte array in the case of OpenQ)
    constructor(address _logic, bytes memory _data)
        payable
        ERC1967Proxy(_logic, _data) //@audit-issue - _data should initialize the implementation contract. Else anyone could initialize the implementation contract and become the owner.
    {}
```

```solidity
    function initialize() external initializer onlyProxy { 
        __Ownable_init();
        __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
        __ReentrancyGuard_init();
    }

## Tool used

VS Code and Manual Review

## Recommendation

Provide the `data` field in the constructor (not an empty byte array as suggested in the comment) of the `OpenQProxy` contract during deployment and provide the keccack256 hash of function signature of the `initialize()` function as `_data` to initialize the `OpenQV1` implementation contract at once. Thus depriving an attacker to front run the initialization of the `OpenQV1` contract.
