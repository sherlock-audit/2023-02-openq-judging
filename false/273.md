# Despite the nonReentrant keyword, reentrancy attacks possibilities

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L68

## Summary
`nonReentrant` only prevents reentrancy within the same function and not from external contracts .

## Vulnerability Detail
The attacker creates a malicious contract that exploits a vulnerability in the `refundDeposit `function . The attacker is able to repeatedly call the function and transfer the deposit to their own address, increasing their balance. This is possible because the `nonReentrant` keyword only prevents reentrancy within the same function and not from external contracts. To prevent this type of attack, the called functions, such as `_transferProtocolToken`, `_transferNft`, and `_transferERC20`, should also be protected from reentrancy attacks.

## Recommendation

To prevent reentrancy attacks is to use a _**mutex or mutual exclusion mechanism**_ that prevents multiple concurrent transfers of the same deposit

```solidity
mapping (bytes32 => bool) private mutex;

function refundDeposit(
    bytes32 _depositId,
    address _funder,
    uint256 _volume
) external virtual onlyDepositManager {
    require(!refunded[_depositId], Errors.DEPOSIT_ALREADY_REFUNDED);
    require(funder[_depositId] == _funder, Errors.CALLER_NOT_FUNDER);
    require(
        block.timestamp >= depositTime[_depositId] + expiration[_depositId],
        Errors.PREMATURE_REFUND_REQUEST
    );

    require(!mutex[_depositId], Errors.DEPOSIT_IN_TRANSFER);

    mutex[_depositId] = true;
    refunded[_depositId] = true;

    if (tokenAddress[_depositId] == address(0)) {
        _transferProtocolToken(funder[_depositId], _volume);
    } else if (isNFT[_depositId]) {
        _transferNft(
            tokenAddress[_depositId],
            funder[_depositId],
            tokenId[_depositId]
        );
    } else {
        _transferERC20(
            tokenAddress[_depositId],
            funder[_depositId],
            _volume
        );
    }

    mutex[_depositId] = false;
}

```
In here, we introduced a new mapping called `mutex` that keeps track of the state of each deposit. When a deposit is being transferred, its corresponding entry in the `mutex `mapping is set to `true`. This prevents other calls to the `refundDeposit` function from transferring the same deposit while it is in transfer. Once the transfer is complete, the `mutex` entry is set back to `false`, allowing future transfers of the deposit.
