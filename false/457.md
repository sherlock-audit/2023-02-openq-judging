# DepositManager.sol funding expiration time serves no external purpose

## Summary

There is no external purpose to add expiration time when funding a bounty. 

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    /// @param _expiration The duration until the deposit becomes refundable
```

Usually, the expiration time is there to make sure that the funder cannot withdraw the funds before the expiration time and bounty hunters cannot earn after expiration time. Since bounty hunters are assured that their funds will not be withdrawn before the expiration time, the expiration gives the bounty hunter a time frame to work because they know that once the bounty is expired, the funder can withdraw the fund.

However, in the protocol, claimManager does not check the expiry date of bounties. This means that the bounties can still be claimed after the expiration is over. In other words, the bounty hunters can still hunt for the bounty after the bounty has expired.

```solidity
    function claimBounty(
        address _bountyAddress,
        address _closer,
        bytes calldata _closerData
    ) external onlyOracle onlyProxy {
        IBounty bounty = IBounty(payable(_bountyAddress));
        uint256 _bountyType = bounty.bountyType();


        if (_bountyType == OpenQDefinitions.ATOMIC) {
            // Decode to ensure data meets closerData schema before emitting any events
            abi.decode(_closerData, (address, string, address, string));


            _claimAtomicBounty(bounty, _closer, _closerData);
            bounty.close(_closer, _closerData);


            emit BountyClosed(
                bounty.bountyId(),
                _bountyAddress,
                bounty.organization(),
                _closer,
                block.timestamp,
                bounty.bountyType(),
                _closerData,
                VERSION_1
            );
        } else if (_bountyType == OpenQDefinitions.ONGOING) {
            _claimOngoingBounty(bounty, _closer, _closerData);
        } else if (_bountyType == OpenQDefinitions.TIERED_PERCENTAGE) {
            _claimTieredPercentageBounty(bounty, _closer, _closerData);
        } else if (_bountyType == OpenQDefinitions.TIERED_FIXED) {
            _claimTieredFixedBounty(bounty, _closer, _closerData);
        } else {
            revert(Errors.UNKNOWN_BOUNTY_TYPE);
        }


        emit ClaimSuccess(block.timestamp, _bountyType, _closerData, VERSION_1);
    }
 ```
 
 In the current rendition of expiration time, bounty hunters can just set their expiration to 1 second since it does not affect anything because bounties have no time limit. The extendDeposit() function, by extension, also serves no purpose because the funders will only be denying themselves of their own fund since expiration does not matter to anyone except the funder himself.
 
 ```solidity
     function extendDeposit(
        bytes32 _depositId,
        uint256 _seconds,
        address _funder
    ) external virtual onlyDepositManager nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
        require(status == OpenQDefinitions.OPEN, Errors.CONTRACT_IS_CLOSED);
        require(!refunded[_depositId], Errors.DEPOSIT_ALREADY_REFUNDED);
        require(funder[_depositId] == _funder, Errors.CALLER_NOT_FUNDER);


        if (
            block.timestamp > depositTime[_depositId] + expiration[_depositId]
        ) {
            expiration[_depositId] =
                block.timestamp -
                depositTime[_depositId] +
                _seconds;
        } else {
            expiration[_depositId] = expiration[_depositId] + _seconds;
        }


        return expiration[_depositId];
    }
```

## Impact

Bounty Hunters may not get their funds if they continue to work after expiration is over.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Enforce the expiration time on the bounties like how the protocol checks the status of the bounties.

```solidity
        require(
            status == OpenQDefinitions.OPEN,
            Errors.CONTRACT_ALREADY_CLOSED
        );
+        @audit require checks on the expiration time of the refunding of bounties to funders.
