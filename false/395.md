# A bounty contract (eg. AtomicBountyV1) always fail to receive a NFT when the DepositManagerV1# `fundBountyNFT()` is called

## Summary
When the DepositManagerV1# `fundBountyNFT()` is called, a bounty contract (eg. AtomicBountyV1) always fail to receive a NFT due to lack of implementation of the IERC721Receiver# `onERC721Received` within the bounty contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the DepositManagerV1# `fundBountyNFT()`, 
a  NFT is transferred from `msg.sender` to `bounty address` via the bounty#`receiveNft()` like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L125-L131
```solidity
    function fundBountyNFT(
        address _bountyAddress,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _tokenId,
        uint256 _expiration,
        bytes calldata _data
    ) external onlyProxy {
        IBounty bounty = IBounty(payable(_bountyAddress));
        ...

        bytes32 depositId = bounty.receiveNft(  /// @audit - a  NFT is transferred from `msg.sender` to `bounty address` 
            msg.sender,
            _tokenAddress,
            _tokenId,
            _expiration,
            _data
        );
       
        ...
```

Within the bounty#`receiveNft()`,
a bounty contract (eg. AtomicBountyV1) receives an NFT by calling the BountyCore# `_receiveNft()` function.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/AtomicBountyV1.sol#L137
```solidity
    function receiveNft(
        address _sender,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _tokenId,
        uint256 _expiration,
        bytes calldata
    ) external onlyDepositManager nonReentrant returns (bytes32) {
        require(
            nftDeposits.length < nftDepositLimit,
            Errors.NFT_DEPOSIT_LIMIT_REACHED
        );
        require(_expiration > 0, Errors.EXPIRATION_NOT_GREATER_THAN_ZERO);
        _receiveNft(_tokenAddress, _sender, _tokenId);  /// @audit 
```

Within the BountyCore# `_receiveNft()`, 
a NFT of `_tokenId` on `_tokenAddress` is transferred from `_sender` (funder) to `bounty address` like this:
By being done so, a bounty contract (eg. AtomicBountyV1) could receives an NFT.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L250
```solidity
    function _receiveNft(
        address _tokenAddress,
        address _sender,
        uint256 _tokenId
    ) internal virtual {
        IERC721Upgradeable nft = IERC721Upgradeable(_tokenAddress);
        nft.safeTransferFrom(_sender, address(this), _tokenId);  /// @audit - a NFT of `_tokenId` on `_tokenAddress` is transferred from `_sender` (funder) to `bounty address` 
    }
```

In case of above, the receiver is a bounty contract (eg. AtomicBountyV1) that is a smart contract.
In case that a NFT is transferred by using [IERC721.safeTransferFrom()](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-safeTransferFrom-address-address-uint256-bytes-) and the receiver of the NFT (ERC721) is the smart contract like above, IERC721Receiver# [onERC721Received](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received-address-address-uint256-bytes-) must be defined within the smart contract of the receiver.
NOTEï¼šBelow is an explanation about above that is written in the OpenZeppelin's document:
>The ERC721 smart contract calls this function on the recipient after a [`IERC721.safeTransferFrom`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-safeTransferFrom-address-address-uint256-bytes-). This function MUST return the function selector, otherwise the caller will revert the transaction. The selector to be returned can be obtained as `this.onERC721Received.selector`. This function MAY throw to revert and reject the transfer. Note: the ERC721 contract address is always the message sender.

However, within the each bounty contracts (eg. AtomicBountyV1) and the inherited-contract of them (eg. BountyCore), there is no  IERC721Receiver# `onERC721Received` defined.

As a result, when the DepositManagerV1# `fundBountyNFT()` is called, a bounty contract (eg. AtomicBountyV1) always fail to receive a NFT.

## Impact
This lead to a bad situation that when the DepositManagerV1# `fundBountyNFT()` is called, a bounty contract (eg. AtomicBountyV1) always fail to receive a NFT.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding the IERC721Receiver# [onERC721Received](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received-address-address-uint256-bytes-) to the each bounty implementation contracts ([AtomicBountyV1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/AtomicBountyV1.sol), [OngoingBountyV1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/OngoingBountyV1.sol), [TieredFixedBountyV1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/TieredFixedBountyV1.sol), [TieredPercentageBountyV1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/TieredPercentageBountyV1.sol)) or the inherited-contract of them ([BountyCore](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol)).
