# MATIC will be lost if used to fund a bounty along with an ERC20 token

## Summary

`fundBountyToken` is used as a gateway to fund bounties with `ERC20` tokens OR native `MATIC`. 
If a funder sends `MATIC` together with an ERC20 deposit, the `MATIC` will be lost and unrefundable.

Funders can send MATIC either intentionally trying to fund MATIC and ERC20 token in the same transaction or by accident  

## Vulnerability Detail

`fundBountyToken` is used to deposit funds to a bounty
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L36-L56

The bounty receives the funds in `receiveFunds`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L41-L45

As can be seen above, `volumeReceived` which is used to specify the amount of tokens received is set to `msg.value` if the token address is the zero address, if not (ERC20 token) it will transfer the token from the sender to the bounty. 

Even though there is no functionality to accept both ERC20 tokens and MATIC in the same transaction, the MATIC will be accepted but not accounted for.

## Impact

MATIC sent as part of funding along an ERC20 token will be permanently lost.

## Recommendation

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L43-L45
In the above `else` clause, add a requirement to validate that `msg.value` is zero.
```solidity
require(msg.value == 0, "Cannot deposit MATIC together with ERC20 token");
```
