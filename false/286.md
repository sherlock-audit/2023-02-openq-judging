# Funds can be locked inside the contract

## Summary
depositManager can refund deposits with refundDeposit(). However, if depositManager doesn't send all funds in the first function call, remaining funds will be locked inside the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L76

When depositManager uses refundDeposit(), refunded[_depositId] will equal true, and the next refundDeposit() will always revert.
