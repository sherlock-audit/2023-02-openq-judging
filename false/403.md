# NFTs cannot be claimed from ongoing bounties; will be stuck forever when refunds disabled

## Summary

OngoingBountyV1 can accept NFT deposits but will never release them in claims. They can only be retrieved by refunds. However, a separate issue  ( https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq-jkoppel/issues/3 ) makes it possible to disable refunds, causing it to be stuck.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. User calls DepositManager.fundBountyNFT for an OngoingBounty, on the mistaken belief that the NFT will be awarded to claimants of the bounty.
2. Griefer performs the attack in  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq-jkoppel/issues/3
3. The NFT is stuck in the contract forever.


## Impact

Anyone who accidentally sends an NFT to an ongoing bounty may lose it forever.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/OngoingBountyV1.sol#L133 provides an implementation of receiveNFT, same as the other bounty types. However, claimOngoingPayout ( https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/OngoingBountyV1.sol#L96 ) does not release the NFTs.
