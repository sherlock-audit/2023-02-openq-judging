# [Stuck fund] Claimer may get less fund in percentage bounty if more than 1 tiers have the same token address

## Summary
Claimer may steal fund in percentage bounty if more than 1 tiers have the same token address.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's say someone deposits 100 A, 100 B, 100 C, and 3 payouts are set to tokens A, B, and C where the schedule is [60, 30, 10]

When claim,

Tier 1 user will get 60 token A
Tier 2 user will get 30 token B
Tier 3 user will get 10 token C

which is correct. However, If A and B is the same


## Impact
Bounty objects become useless
