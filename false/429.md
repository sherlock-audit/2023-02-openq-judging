# Events can be spoofed.

## Summary
Many methods do not check bounty authenticity, leading to the possibility of emiting spoofed events. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Many methods that receive `_bountyAddress` as input from users (`fundBountyToken`, `extendDeposit`, `fundBountyNFT`,  `refundDeposit`, `claimBounty`, `permissionedClaimTieredBounty`, `_claimAtomicBounty`) do not check if `_bountyAddress` belong to a valid bounty minted by OpenQ's `mintBounty`. Therefore malicious actors can deploy a fake bounty contract only to be used to spoof events from these methods.

All the events emitted from the methods cited above, like `NFTDepositReceived`, `DepositRefunded`, `DepositExtended`, `ClaimSuccess`, `TokenBalanceClaimed`, `NFTClaimed` , `BountyClosed` can be spoofed. Those events are going to be processed and indexed off-chain as described in the docs, possibly affecting OpenQ off-chain service funcionality.

Many of the events contain identifiers like `address(_bounty),` which under scrutiny can be used to differentiate between real events and the spoofed ones. But there are some that are undifferentiable, like `DepositExtended` and `ClaimSuccess`.

## Impact
Off-chain service functionality could be affected, mainly with spoofed events like `DepositExtended` and `ClaimSuccess` that are impossible to be differentiated from authentic ones.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using `bountyId` instead of `bountyAddress` as input to the methods cited above. `bountyId` can be checked and the corresponding valid `bountyAddress` can be easily retrieved, as shown in the example below.
