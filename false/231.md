# `call()` should be used instead of `safeTransferFrom()` on an address payable

## Summary
`call()` should be used instead of safeTransferFrom() on an address payable.

## Vulnerability Detail
The transfer() and send() functions forward a fixed amount of 2300 gas. Historically, it has often been recommended to use these functions for value transfers to guard against reentrancy attacks. However, the gas cost of EVM instructions may change significantly during hard forks which may break already deployed contract systems that make fixed assumptions about gas costs.

## Impact
Function `fundBountyToken` in [DepositManagerV1.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L36) is payable. This function call `receiveFunds` in [BountyCore.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L21) which is also a payable. It also invokes another function [_receiveERC20](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L197) which uses `safeTransferFrom`.

## Code Snippet
[DepositManagerV1.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L36)
```solidity
42: function fundBountyToken(
        address _bountyAddress,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _volume,
        uint256 _expiration,
        string memory funderUuid
    ) external payable onlyProxy {  
	............
54: (bytes32 depositId, uint256 volumeReceived) = bounty.receiveFunds{
```
[BountyCore.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L21)
```solidity
21: function receiveFunds(
        address _funder,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _volume,
        uint256 _expiration
    )
        external
        payable  //@audit - using transfer on payable function
        virtual
        onlyDepositManager
        nonReentrant
        returns (bytes32, uint256)
		...........
44: volumeReceived = _receiveERC20(_tokenAddress, _funder, _volume);
```
[_receiveERC20](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L197)
```solidity
204: token.safeTransferFrom(_funder, address(this), _volume);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend using `call()` method instead of `safeTransferFrom()` or remove `payable`.
