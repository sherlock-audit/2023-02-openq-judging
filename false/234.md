# Unvalidated Input in claimOngoingPayout Function of OngoingBountyV1 Contract.

## Summary
`OngoingBountyV1` doesn't validate its `claimOngoingPayout` function. It decodes the `_closerData` parameter but fails to validate the input, leading to potential manipulation. This could result in unauthorized actions and the alteration of the contract state.

## Vulnerability Detail
When you properly look into the `claimOngoingPayout` function in the `OngoingBountyV1`. This function takes in two parameters. `_payoutAddress` and `_closerData`, both of which are used to transfer a payout to a claimant for a specific asset. 

The `_closerData` parameter is an ABI-encoded data that includes the claimant and the claimant asset. But this function does not properly validate the input of the `_closerData` parameter.

## Impact
Input in the `claimOngoingPayout` function, which is used to transfer a payout amount of an ongoing bounty to a claimant for a claimant asset. The function takes an "ABI-encoded" `_closerData` parameter but does not properly validate the input. If it is manipulated in any way, it can cause unintended behavior, such as transferring an incorrect amount of funds or even stealing it.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Validate the input of the `claimOngoingPayout` function before using it. You can do it by checking the format, length, and range of the input data and ensuring that it matches the expected values. If the input data is not valid, in that case the function should revert with an error message.
