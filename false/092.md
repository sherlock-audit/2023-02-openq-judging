# Verify data length

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/AtomicBountyV1.sol#L36

## Summary
 Data length check is required for not face to memory overflow  

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
require(bytes(_bountyId).length != 0, Errors.NO_EMPTY_BOUNTY_ID);
require(bytes(_organization).length != 0, Errors.NO_EMPTY_ORGANIZATION);
```
These look to see if the strings are empty, not their length which may cause potential memory overflow.

## Recommendation

```solidity
require(bytes(_bountyId).length != 0 && bytes(_bountyId).length <= MAX_BOUNTY_ID_LENGTH, Errors.INVALID_BOUNTY_ID_LENGTH);
require(bytes(_organization).length != 0 && bytes(_organization).length <= MAX_ORGANIZATION_LENGTH, Errors.INVALID_ORGANIZATION_LENGTH);
```
The above  `MAX_BOUNTY_ID_LENGTH` and `MAX_ORGANIZATION_LENGTH` are constants, 
it can ensure that the maximum allowed lengths for `__bountyId` and `__organization`. I think this will help to prevent memory overflows by ensuring that the encoded bytes do not exceed the maximum allowed length.
