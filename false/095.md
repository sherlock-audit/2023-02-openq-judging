# The hidden threat to Smart Contract security

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/AtomicBountyV1.sol#L79


## Summary
There are lack of checks for overflow/underflow and input validity to prevent potential security risks. 


## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
 fundingGoal = _fundingGoal;
```
   There is no check for overflow/underflow of `fundingGoal` variables. For this why values can become very large and cause unintended behavior.

## Impact
High


## Code Snippet
Manually Review

## Tool used
Manually Review

### Manual Review
Done

## Recommendation
```solidity
uint256 allowableGoal = 2**256 - 1;  // The maximum value
// Check if the funding goal is within the allowable range
   require(_fundingGoal <= allowableGoal, "ERROR: Funding goal exceeds the maximum value");
```
Add a check that ensures the value of `fundingGoal` does not exceed the maximum value.
