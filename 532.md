# Bounty contracts' state can be corrupted as a result of an upgrade

## Summary
Upgrading one of the bounty contracts and adding a state variable, or appending a contract with a state variable to the inheritance list of `BountyStorageCore`, may corrupt the state of the bounty contracts and make the non-operational.
## Vulnerability Detail
The [BountyStorageCore](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Storage/BountyStorageCore.sol#L24) contract defines the common state variables of all the bounty contracts. The contract inherits from other contracts (some of which define their own state variables), and there's a warning in the contract's documentation:
> Backwards compatible, append-only chain of storage contracts inherited by all (Type)BountyStorage implementations

I.e. new dependencies must be added in the append-only way: new dependencies must be added to the end of the list of the contracts `BountyStorageCore` inherits from. However, this won't protect from possible state corruption.

There're multiple situations when the state of any of the bounty contracts can be corrupted as a result of an upgrade:
1. First, new contracts must not be added to the inheritance list of `BountyStorageCore`. In case a new contract with one or multiple state variables is added, all state variables of `BountyStorageCore` will be shifted down (their slot index will increase).
1. `ClaimManagerOwnable` and `DepositManagerOwnable`, from which `BountyStorageCore` inherits, don't reserve gap slots (unlike the other contracts it inherits from). In case any of these contracts is upgraded and a new state variable is added, all state variables of `BountyStorageCore` will be shifted down (their slot index will increase).
1. `BountyStorageCore` itself doesn't reserve gap slots, however other contracts inherit from it:
    1. [AtomicBountyStorageV1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Storage/AtomicBountyStorage.sol#L10) <- [BountyCore](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L10) <- `BountyStorageCore`;
    1. [TieredFixedBountyStorageV1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Storage/TieredFixedBountyStorage.sol#L10) <- [TieredBountyStorageCore](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Storage/TieredBountyStorageCore.sol#L10) <- [BountyCore](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L10) <- `BountyStorageCore`;
    1. [OngoingBountyStorageV1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Storage/OngoingBountyStorage.sol#L10) <- [BountyCore](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L10) <- `BountyStorageCore`.

    `AtomicBountyStorageV1`, `TieredFixedBountyStorageV1`, `TieredBountyStorageCore`, and `OngoingBountyStorageV1` define their own state variables. This means that if, as a result of an upgrade, a new state variable is added to `BountyStorageCore` (or some state variables are removed), the state variables of these contracts will be shifted (their slot index will increase).
## Impact
The state of all the bounty contracts can be corrupted as a result of an upgrade that: adds a new inheritance to `BountyStorageCore`, adds or removes a state variable from `ClaimManagerOwnable` or `DepositManagerOwnable`, or adds or removes a state variable from `BountyStorageCore`.

Manual Review
## Recommendation
Consider these changes:
1. Update the documentation of the `BountyStorageCore` contract and add a note that warns against adding new parent contracts.
1. Add `uint256[49] private __gap` to the bottom of `ClaimManagerOwnable` and `DepositManagerOwnable` (similarly to `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable` and `ERC721HolderUpgradeable`) to reserve storage slots for future updates of the contracts.
1. Reserve storage slots in the `BountyStorageCore` contract so that the total storage slots use by the contract is always exactly 50 (or more if you expect that the contract will use more than 50 storage slots in the future).
