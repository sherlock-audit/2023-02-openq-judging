# The `claimedBalance` for some tier may be shortfall when the TieredFixedBountyV1# `claimTieredFixed()` is called for that tier

## Summary
Through the claiming (payout) process for the TieredFixedBountyV1, there is no validation to check whether or not the `total claimable amount` is already reached the `fundingTotals` of payout token (`_tokenAddress`) in the TieredFixedBountyV1 contract. 

This lead to a bad situation that when the TieredFixedBountyV1# `claimTieredFixed()` is called for some tier, the `claimedBalance` for that tier may be shortfall if the `fundingTotals` of payout token is not reached the `total claimable amount`. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the TieredBountyStorageCore, the `fundingTotals` is defined as a state variable to store `total funded-balance` of payout token address in the TieredBounty contracts (TieredFixedBountyV1 and TieredPercentageBountyV1) like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Storage/TieredBountyStorageCore.sol#L16
```solidity
    mapping(address => uint256) public fundingTotals;
```

Within the TieredBountyStorageCore, the `payoutSchedule` is also defined as an array of the `payout volumes` for each tier. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Storage/TieredBountyStorageCore.sol#L15
```solidity
    /// @dev [0] is 1st place, [1] is 2nd, etc.
    uint256[] public payoutSchedule;
```

In case of the `TieredFixedBountyV1`, each `payment volumes` stored into the `payoutSchedule` array would be dealt as an `amount` of the payout tokens.

Within the TieredFixedBountyV1# `claimTieredFixed()`,
the `claimedBalance` that is the fixed amount of a payout token (`_payoutAddress`) associated with the tier would be transferred (paid out) into the claimant (`payoutTokenAddress`) via the BountyCore# `_transferToken()`  like this::
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/TieredFixedBountyV1.sol#L103-L105
```solidity
    function claimTieredFixed(address _payoutAddress, uint256 _tier)
        external
        onlyClaimManager
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256)
    {
        ...

        uint256 claimedBalance = payoutSchedule[_tier];  /// @audit 

        _transferToken(payoutTokenAddress, claimedBalance, _payoutAddress); /// @audit
        return claimedBalance;
    }
```

Within the BountyCore# `_transferToken()` , the `claimedBalance` of the payout token is transferred via the BountyCore# `_transferProtocolToken()` or `_transferERC20()` depends on the payout token address like below:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L186-L190
```solidity
    function _transferToken(
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _volume,
        address _payoutAddress
    ) internal virtual {
        if (_tokenAddress == address(0)) {
            _transferProtocolToken(_payoutAddress, _volume);  /// @audit 
        } else {
            _transferERC20(_tokenAddress, _payoutAddress, _volume);  /// @audit 
        }
    }
```
However, the claiming (payout) process for the TieredFixedBountyV1 above, there is no validation to check whether or not the `total claimable amount` is already reached the `fundingTotals` of payout token (`_tokenAddress`) in the TieredFixedBountyV1 contract. 

This lead to a bad situation that when the TieredFixedBountyV1# `claimTieredFixed()` is called for some tier, the `claimedBalance` for that tier may be shortfall if the `fundingTotals` of payout token is not reached the `total claimable amount`. 

Example).
Let's say each tiers and payout amount are set like this:
- 1st place (tier 1): 1000
- 2nd place (tier 2): 500
- 3rd place (tier 3): 200
In case of above, the total `claimableBalance` should be 1700.

However, let's consider a case that the `fundingTotals` of the payout token in the TieredFixedBountyV1 contract is still 700 that is not reached the total `claimableBalance` above (1700) when the TieredFixedBountyV1# `claimTieredFixed()` is called.
If the 2nd place (tier 2) and the 3rd place (tier 3) calls the TieredFixedBountyV1# `claimTieredFixed()` before the 1st place (tier 1) calls it, the `claimedBalance` for the 1st place (tier 1) will be shortfall like this:
- ① The OpenQ oracle calls the TieredFixedBountyV1# `claimTieredFixed()` for the 2nd place (tier 2) and then 500 is paid out --> actual remained-balance of payout token in the TieredFixedBountyV1 contract: 200
- ② The OpenQ oracle calls the TieredFixedBountyV1# `claimTieredFixed()` for the 3rd place (tier 3) and then 200 is paid out --> actual remained-balance of payout token in the TieredFixedBountyV1 contract: 0
- ③ The OpenQ oracle calls the TieredFixedBountyV1# `claimTieredFixed()` for the 1st place (tier 1) and then the transaction will be fail because of that the `fundingTotals` remained is already 0 after Step② is done above.

NOTE: TieredPercentageBountyV1# `claimTiered()` also has the same vulnerability.

## Impact
This lead to a bad situation that when the TieredFixedBountyV1# `claimTieredFixed()` is called for some tier, the `claimedBalance` for that tier may be shortfall.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a validation to check whether the `fundTotals` is already reach the total `claimedBalance` to the TieredFixedBountyV1# `claimTieredFixed()` is called like this:
```solidity
    function claimTieredFixed(address _payoutAddress, uint256 _tier)
        external
        onlyClaimManager
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256)
    {
        ...

        /// @audit - Add the code like below in order to calculate the total claimable balance like this:
        uint256 totalClaimableBalance;
        for (uint256 i=0; i < payoutSchedule.length; i++) {
            totalClaimableBalance += payoutSchedule[i]
        }

        /// @audit - Add the code like below in order to check whether or not the "fundingTotals" would be already reach the total claimable balance like this:
        require(fundingTotals >=  totalClaimableBalance, "fundingTotals is shortfall to claim");

        uint256 claimedBalance = payoutSchedule[_tier]; 

        _transferToken(payoutTokenAddress, claimedBalance, _payoutAddress);
        return claimedBalance;
    }
```

NOTE: The TieredPercentageBountyV1# `claimTiered()` also has the same vulnerability. Thus, similar code like above should be added into the TieredPercentageBountyV1# `claimTiered()` as well.
