# Weak logic about refund after bounty close

## Summary
refundDeposit() logic has a weakness in BountyCore contract

## Vulnerability Detail
If 10 sponsors deposit 1 ETH each and bountyâ€™s payout was 9 ETH, there will be 1 ETH left in bounty. Then the sponsor who takes the ETH left in the bounty first will take all of the refund amount. After the Bounty, there should be logic to divide the remaining deposits according to the deposit ratio, so sponsors can take their own share.

Since AtomicBountyV1 contrcat payout all the token in contract, so it is fine. However, there is possiblity to be balance left in OngoingBountyV1 contract.

## Impact
Sponsor may no longer use the protocol due to unfair refund logic
