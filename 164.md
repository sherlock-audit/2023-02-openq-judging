# Tier bountry may not be able to add NFT prizes

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

For security reasons, the number of deposited NFTs is currently limited to no more than 5

if the bounty type is TIERED_PERCENTAGE or  TIERED_FIXED 
```payoutSchedule``` is used to record how many winners there are 
We can award the NFT to the winner of the corresponding ranking
There is no limit to the number of payoutSchedule
This leads to a situation： if the payoutSchedule length is greater than 5, then it is impossible to provide NFT to the people behind 5

Example:
We have 6 winners (payoutSchedule[].length==6)

1.fundBountyNFT(NFT_ID = 1, tier = 1)   --->ok
2.fundBountyNFT(NFT_ID = 2, tier =2)   --->ok
3.fundBountyNFT(NFT_ID = 3, tier = 3)   --->ok
4.fundBountyNFT(NFT_ID = 4, tier = 4)   --->ok
5.fundBountyNFT(NFT_ID = 5, tier = 5)   --->ok
6.fundBountyNFT(NFT_ID = 6, tier = 6)   --->revert,  Errors.NFT_DEPOSIT_LIMIT_REACHED

```solidity

    function receiveNft(
        address _sender,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _tokenId,
        uint256 _expiration,
        bytes calldata _data
    ) external override onlyDepositManager nonReentrant returns (bytes32) {
        require(
            nftDeposits.length < nftDepositLimit,   //@audit <-------- nftDepositLimit=5 and can't change it
            Errors.NFT_DEPOSIT_LIMIT_REACHED
        );
```

suggest:
1.If the current nftDeposits length is less than or equal to the payoutSchedule length, then it is not limited by nftDepositLimit
2.adding the issuer can modify nftDepositLimit   （For the case if a tier can have multiple NFT bounty）
