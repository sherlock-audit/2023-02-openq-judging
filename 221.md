# Incompatible with revert-on-zero-value-transfers tokens

## Summary
_transferERERC20 does not check _volume > 0. When the token is a revert-on-zero-value-transfers token, _transferERERC20 will fail
## Vulnerability Detail
_transferERERC20 does not check _volume > 0. When the token is a revert-on-zero-value-transfers token, _transferERERC20 will fail. 
https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20/#revert-on-zero-value-transfers
```solidity
    function _transferERC20(
        address _tokenAddress,
        address _payoutAddress,
        uint256 _volume
    ) internal virtual {
        IERC20Upgradeable token = IERC20Upgradeable(_tokenAddress);
        token.safeTransfer(_payoutAddress, _volume);
    }
```
Consider the following scenario, where user deposits some revert-on-zero-value-transfers token into AtomicBounty and then refunds it via refundDeposit.
At this point this token balance in the contract is 0.
In _claimAtomicBounty, 0 of this tokens are transferred to the winner, which reverts, resulting in the winner not being able to claim the prize
```solidity
    function _claimAtomicBounty(
        IAtomicBounty _bounty,
        address _closer,
        bytes calldata _closerData
    ) internal {
        _eligibleToClaimAtomicBounty(_bounty, _closer);

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _bounty.getTokenAddresses().length; i++) {
            uint256 volume = _bounty.claimBalance(
                _closer,
                _bounty.getTokenAddresses()[i]
            );
```
## Impact
the winner not being able to claim the prize

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change to
```diff
    function _transferERC20(
        address _tokenAddress,
        address _payoutAddress,
        uint256 _volume
    ) internal virtual {
        IERC20Upgradeable token = IERC20Upgradeable(_tokenAddress);
+      if(_volume > 0)
        token.safeTransfer(_payoutAddress, _volume);
    }
```
