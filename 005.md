# Unbounded loop in BounyCore.getLockedFunds function leads to DOS in DepositManagerV1.refundDeposit function

## Summary
The `BountyCore.getLockedFunds` function loops over all deposits:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L340-L341

The issue is that the attacker can create as many deposits as he wants with a very small value such that there is essentially only the gas cost he has to pay.

The `BountyCore.getLockedFunds` function can then consume a lot of gas or even revert due to running out of gas.

However the `DepositManagerV1.refundDeposit` function makes use of the `BountyCore.getLockedFunds` function:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L171-L172

## Vulnerability Detail
The attacker can cause the call to `BountyCore.getLockedFunds` to revert.

Therefore he can cause the call to `DepositMangerV1.refundDeposits` to revert.

This makes it impossible to refund deposits.

## Impact
DOS in the refund deposit functionality.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The information that the `DepositManagerV1.refundDeposit` function makes use of must be available without looping over all deposits.

Alternatively don't allow any user to create deposits. Maybe only from a whitelist configured by the bounty issuer.
