# A partial refund using ``BountyCore.refundDeposit()`` will block ALL future partial/full refunds.

## Summary
A partial refund using ``BountyCore.refundDeposit()`` will block ALL future partial/full refunds. Ideally, future refunds should always be possible until there is no fund to refund. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Suppose the ``DepositManager`` calls ``BountyCore.refundDeposit)`` to initiate a partial refund: 
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L64-L93](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L64-L93)

After this, ``refunded[_depositId] = true``, as a result, a future refund, either partial or full,  is impossible since a call to ``BountyCore.refundDeposit()`` will revert due to the following check: 

```solidity
        require(!refunded[_depositId], Errors.DEPOSIT_ALREADY_REFUNDED);
```
## Impact
Once there is a partial refund, any future refunds, partial or full, becomes impossible. In real life, multiple refunds or even full refund might be necessary. 

## Code Snippet
See above

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We should always allow refunds as long as there is still fund. Check the remaining volume after refund, only set ``refunded[_depositId]`` to false when ``volume[depositId] = 0``.
