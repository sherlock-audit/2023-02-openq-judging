# Malicious token can be used to fund bounty and prevent claiming of funds.

## Summary
As long as the `tokenAddressLimitReached` hasn't been reached any token that is not whitelisted can be used to fund a bounty. An attacker can use this to fund a bounty with a token that reverts when a user tries claiming their funds after completing a job. This would prevent the claimant from receiving all the other non-malicious tokens that the bounty was also funded with.

## Vulnerability Detail
Valid for: ATOMIC
- Attacker funds bounty with malicious token that reverts on transfer, preventing `_claimAtomicBounty` `for` loops to execute. Can prevent claimant from withdrawing fungible and non-fungible tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Require `funder` to fund bounties with whitelisted tokens only.
Change Code Snippet above to:
```solidity
        require (isWhitelisted(_tokenAddress), Errors.TOKEN_NOT_WHITELISTED);
```
