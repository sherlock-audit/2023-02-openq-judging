# Minor Bug in the setPayoutScheduleFixed function

Hey there - quick disclaimer, I am a Junior Frontend Engineer at OpenQ itself since last summer. I just found a bug and with permission of my team decided to report it here - but out of fairness to other participants wanted to let you know upfront that I am part of the OpenQ team.

## Summary
When changing the amount of tiers to a lower amount using the function 'setPayoutScheduleFixed', the smart contract will throw an error due to trying to access a non-existing index in the newly created array (which is shorter than the older one).

## Vulnerability Detail
Causing the function to bug and throw an error.

## Impact
Low, just throwing an error and preventing the change to happen.

## Code Snippet

```solidity

function setPayoutScheduleFixed(
        uint256[] calldata _payoutSchedule,
        address _payoutTokenAddress
    ) external onlyOpenQ {
        require(
            bountyType == OpenQDefinitions.TIERED_FIXED,
            Errors.NOT_A_FIXED_TIERED_BOUNTY
        );
        payoutSchedule = _payoutSchedule;
        payoutTokenAddress = _payoutTokenAddress;

        // Resize metadata arrays and copy current members to new array
        // NOTE: If resizing to fewer tiers than previously, the final indexes will be removed
        string[] memory newTierWinners = new string[](payoutSchedule.length);
        bool[] memory newInvoiceComplete = new bool[](payoutSchedule.length);
        bool[] memory newSupportingDocumentsCompleted = new bool[](
            payoutSchedule.length
        );

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tierWinners.length; i++) {
            newTierWinners[i] = tierWinners[i];
        }
        tierWinners = newTierWinners;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < invoiceComplete.length; i++) {
            newInvoiceComplete[i] = invoiceComplete[i];
        }
        invoiceComplete = newInvoiceComplete;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < supportingDocumentsComplete.length; i++) {
            newSupportingDocumentsCompleted[i] = supportingDocumentsComplete[i];
        }
        supportingDocumentsComplete = newSupportingDocumentsCompleted;
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

Just found a bug when testing the frontend: was getting an error when trying to change the payout schedule to less tiers than initially.

## Recommendation


```solidity

       for (uint256 i = 0; i < tierWinners.length && i < newTierWinners.length; i++) {
            newTierWinners[i] = tierWinners[i];
        }
        tierWinners = newTierWinners;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < invoiceComplete.length && i < newInvoiceComplete.length; i++) {
            newInvoiceComplete[i] = invoiceComplete[i];
        }
        invoiceComplete = newInvoiceComplete;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < supportingDocumentsComplete.length && i < newSupportingDocumentsCompleted.length; i++) {
            newSupportingDocumentsCompleted[i] = supportingDocumentsComplete[i];
        }
        supportingDocumentsComplete = newSupportingDocumentsCompleted;

```
