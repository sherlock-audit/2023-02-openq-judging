# [Fund stuck] Fund could stuck if payment schedule number is less than the token address number in Percentage Tier Bounty

## Summary
The fund could stuck if the payment schedule number is less than the token address number in Percentage Tier Bounty

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's make an example.

1. Only 1 payout schedule set (Which is 100)
2. 600 MockLink and 600 mockDai is deposited 
3. CloseCompetition
4. Claim tiered for MockLink
5. Claim tiered for mockDai (Failed!)

Written a test unit for this in TieredPercentageBounty.test.js

```solidity
it.only('should transfer volume of tokenAddress balance based on payoutSchedule', async () => {
    await tieredContract.setPayoutSchedule([100]);
    const [, firstPlace] = await ethers.getSigners();
    await tieredContract.connect(depositManager).receiveFunds(owner.address, mockLink.address, 600, Constants.thirtyDays); // 600
    await tieredContract.connect(depositManager).receiveFunds(owner.address, mockDai.address, 600, Constants.thirtyDays); // 600

    await tieredContract.connect(claimManager).closeCompetition();
    await tieredContract.connect(claimManager).claimTiered(firstPlace.address, 0, mockLink.address);
    
    await expect(tieredContract.connect(claimManager).claimTiered(firstPlace.address, 1, mockDai.address)).to.be.revertedWith('0x32'); // unable to claim
    });
})
```

## Impact
As so far the only way to withdraw coin is to claim it, mockDai could be stuck forever

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Restrict the number of DISTINCT deposit token addresses should be the same as the payment schedule array length number
