# Ongoing bounty does not release NFT

## Summary
Ongoing bounty has provision to deposit NFT. On completing a task both ERC20 and NFT should be released in Ongoing bounty. But it seems only ERC20 token is released and NFT are never given on completing task

## Vulnerability Detail
1. User U1 completes the task for an Ongoing bounty
2. U1 claims the bounty which calls `_claimOngoingBounty` function

```solidity
function _claimOngoingBounty(
        IOngoingBounty _bounty,
        address _closer,
        bytes calldata _closerData
    ) internal {
        _eligibleToClaimOngoingBounty(_bounty, _closer, _closerData);

        (address tokenAddress, uint256 volume) = _bounty.claimOngoingPayout(
            _closer,
            _closerData
        );

        emit TokenBalanceClaimed(
            _bounty.bountyId(),
            address(_bounty),
            _bounty.organization(),
            _closer,
            block.timestamp,
            tokenAddress,
            volume,
            _bounty.bountyType(),
            _closerData,
            VERSION_1
        );
    }
```

3. As we can see this is not releasing the NFT and only the ERC20 token

## Impact
User will lose the NFT even after completing task

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add logic to also allow releasing of NFT after user has completing the task
