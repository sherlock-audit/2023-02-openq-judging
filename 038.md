# Bounties can be paid with expired deposits

## Summary
Bounties don't differentiate between locked and expired deposits when paying out claims.

## Vulnerability Detail
Expired deposits should be left untouched since they theoretically belong to the funder and wait to be refunded. But, bounties use any funds they own to pay out claims.

This forces depositors to refund *immediately* after their deposit expired. Otherwise, they run into the risk of losing their assets. From a depositor's viewpoint, this is pretty bad UX and is bound to cause headaches in the future.

## Impact
Depositors risk losing their deposits if they don't refund immediately after their deposit expired.

## Code Snippet
AtomicBountyV1 sends the contract's whole balance disregarding expired deposits: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/AtomicBountyV1.sol#L89
```sol
    /// @notice Transfers full balance of _tokenAddress from bounty to _payoutAddress
    /// @param _tokenAddress ERC20 token address or Zero Address for protocol token
    /// @param _payoutAddress The destination address for the funds
    function claimBalance(address _payoutAddress, address _tokenAddress)
        external
        onlyClaimManager
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256)
    {
        uint256 claimedBalance = getTokenBalance(_tokenAddress);
        _transferToken(_tokenAddress, claimedBalance, _payoutAddress);
        return claimedBalance;
    }
```
OngoingBountyV1 doesn't verify that the locked deposits are enough to cover the claim: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/OngoingBountyV1.sol#LL110
```sol
    function claimOngoingPayout(
        address _payoutAddress,
        bytes calldata _closerData
    ) external onlyClaimManager nonReentrant returns (address, uint256) {
        (, string memory claimant, , string memory claimantAsset) = abi.decode(
            _closerData,
            (address, string, address, string)
        );

        bytes32 _claimId = generateClaimId(claimant, claimantAsset);

        claimId[_claimId] = true;
        claimIds.push(_claimId);

        _transferToken(payoutTokenAddress, payoutVolume, _payoutAddress);
        return (payoutTokenAddress, payoutVolume);
    }
```

Same thing is done in `TieredFixedBountyV1.claimTieredFixed()` and `TieredPercentageBountyV1.claimTiered()`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Expired deposits should be excluded from the bounty's balance.
