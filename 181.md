# After the bounty completely distributed, the remaining tokens can be locked into the contracts

## Summary
There are some cases that the reward tokens were left in the ongoingBounty because total balance exceeded the `payoutVolume` of the bounty. But no one can't claim the remaining because of underflow error. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Since the ongoing bounty doesn't restrict who can deposit into it, there are some scenarios that there is an amount of reward tokens remaining after the payout is completely distributed. 
The question is what happen with the remaining payout, who can receive it ? The answer is anyone who has deposited into the bounty before can receive the portion of the bounty based on their deposit amount and deposit tokens. Simply a user with a bounty which has the expiry time less than block.timestamp can call `DepositManagerV1.refundDeposit()` to claim `min(volume, availableFunds)` tokenAddress back. 
But in some rare cases when there are some funders locked their fund forever, users can't claim the remaining. Here is a example of this scenario: 

0. Issuer call `OngoingBountyV1.setPayout()` with `payoutVolume = 1500 USDC` 
1. Alice deposits 1000 USDC into bounty with expiry time = 1
2. Bob who is doing charity deposits 1000 USDC into bounty with expiry time = inf 
3. Competitor claims their reward --> there are `1000 + 1000 - 1500 = 500 USDC` left in the contract
4. Alice try to call `DepositManagerV1.refundDeposit()` to claim the remaining reward in the bounty. But the transaction revert when she call it. Is there something happening with the tx ? 

The `DepositManagerV1.refundDeposit()` is implemented as follows: 
```solidity=
function refundDeposit(address _bountyAddress, bytes32 _depositId)
        external
        onlyProxy
    {
        /// ... 

        address depToken = bounty.tokenAddress(_depositId);
        
        uint256 availableFunds = bounty.getTokenBalance(depToken) -
            bounty.getLockedFunds(depToken);

        uint256 volume;
        if (bounty.volume(_depositId) <= availableFunds) {
            volume = bounty.volume(_depositId);
        } else {
            volume = availableFunds;
        }

        bounty.refundDeposit(_depositId, msg.sender, volume);

        /// ... 
    }
```
Based on the implementation, we get: 
* `bounty.getTokenBalance(depToken) = 500 USDC`
* `bounty.getLockedFunds(depToken) = 1000 USDC` since there is just a deposit from Bob is locked. 
* `availableFunds = bounty.getTokenBalance(depToken)  - bounty.getLockedFunds(depToken) = 500 - 1000 < 0`

Revert because of underflow error.

## Impact
User can't claim the remaining rewards

Manual review 

## Recommendation
Let the issuer mark the payout has completely. After that the expiry time of the deposits should be redundant.
