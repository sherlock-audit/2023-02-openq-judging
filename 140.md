# Attacker can steal other user bounty - Ongoing Bounty

## Summary
A user participating in Ongoing bounty can complete the task, claim bounty, again claim bounty,..., until contract is deprived of funds

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Attacker A1 completes a task for an Ongoing bounty
2. Attacker claims the bounty using `claimBounty` function
3. This internally calls `claimOngoingPayout`

```solidity
function claimOngoingPayout(
        address _payoutAddress,
        bytes calldata _closerData
    ) external onlyClaimManager nonReentrant returns (address, uint256) {
        (, string memory claimant, , string memory claimantAsset) = abi.decode(
            _closerData,
            (address, string, address, string)
        );

        bytes32 _claimId = generateClaimId(claimant, claimantAsset);

        claimId[_claimId] = true;
        claimIds.push(_claimId);

        _transferToken(payoutTokenAddress, payoutVolume, _payoutAddress);
        return (payoutTokenAddress, payoutVolume);
    }
```
4. Since Attacker actually completed the task so bounty is released
5. Now Attacker again claim the bounty using `claimBounty` function with same params as Step 2
6. Since there is no check to verify if user has already claimed in `claimOngoingPayout` function, so this claim is also processed and funds are released to Attacker
7. Attacker keeps on claiming until contract is deprived of funds

## Impact
Attacker can steal bounty meant for other tasks without completing those tasks

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
deposit id should be part of claimId and once user has claimed, below check should be added

```solidity
require(!claimId[_claimId], "Already claimed");
```
