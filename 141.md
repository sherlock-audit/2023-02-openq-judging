# User will not get bounty

## Summary
The claimId is currently derived from `claimant, claimantAsset` which means if User has completed 2 tasks with same claimantAsset then both claimId will be same. If one of the bounty is claimed then `claimId[_claimId] ` which means as per system, user 2nd task bounty is also claimed which is incorrect

## Vulnerability Detail
1. User A completed 2 task for an Ongoing bounty
2. User A claims the bounty for 1st task for which oracle calls `claimBounty` function
3. This internally calls `claimOngoingPayout` function which marks the claimId as claimed

```solidity
function claimOngoingPayout(
        address _payoutAddress,
        bytes calldata _closerData
    ) external onlyClaimManager nonReentrant returns (address, uint256) {
        (, string memory claimant, , string memory claimantAsset) = abi.decode(
            _closerData,
            (address, string, address, string)
        );

        bytes32 _claimId = generateClaimId(claimant, claimantAsset);

        claimId[_claimId] = true;
        claimIds.push(_claimId);
...
```

4. User A makes the claim for 2nd task and `claimOngoingPayout` is again called
5. This time `claimId[_claimId]` is already true even though this claim was never made (A check is missing in contract to see if its a attempt to get duplicate bounty, described in another bug)

## Impact
User will not be able to claim bounty even after completing task

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add another component `depositId` to the claimId which will isolate one claim from another made by same user
