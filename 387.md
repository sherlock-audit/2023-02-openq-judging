# Fund tier fixed bounty with other tokens

## Summary
`TieredFixedBounty` can be funded with other tokens but only one token can be claimed by the winners.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `TieredFixedBountyV1`, the winner can only claim `payoutTokenAddress` tokens:
```solidity
    function claimTieredFixed(address _payoutAddress, uint256 _tier)
       ...
    {
        ...
        uint256 claimedBalance = payoutSchedule[_tier];
        _transferToken(payoutTokenAddress, claimedBalance, _payoutAddress);
        ...
    }
```
However, it is possible that this bounty was also funded with other tokens because
    `TieredFixedBountyV1 is TieredFixedBountyStorageV1 is TieredBountyCore is TieredBountyStorageCore is BountyCore` contains `function receiveFunds`.
This function does not revert if the `_tokenAddress` is not `payoutTokenAddress`.

## Impact
If this type of bounty is accidentally funded with other tokens, it will cause some inconvenience, and funders will have to wait for expiration to refund.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Probably this bounty contract should override the `receiveFunds` function and revert when the token is not the specified `payoutTokenAddress`.
