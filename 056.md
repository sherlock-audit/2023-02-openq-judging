# No validation if `bountyAddress` is valid could lead to loss of funds.

## Summary
Attacker could provide malicious bounty address to potential `funder` and steal his assets as funder things he is depositing in a bounty, when in reality the `_bountyAddress` provided was not a bounty created through `mintBounty()`

## Vulnerability Detail

There is no check to ensure `_bountyAddress` is an address that has been created through the `mintBounty()` function.

Consequently a malicious address that contains similar variables and functions could be created to fool a `funder` to deposit funds in such address.

More specifically the fake `bountyAddress` only needs to implements methods like:
- `status()`

- `receiveFunds()`

- `bountyId()`
- `organization()`

## Impact
`funder` will lose his assets.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a mapping that states whether the `_bountyAddress` is valid or not and check validity of bounty against such mapping.
