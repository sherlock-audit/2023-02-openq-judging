# getInvoiceComplete() might return some claimIds who have not completed the invoices.

## Summary
``getInvoiceComplete()`` might return ``claimIds`` who have actually not completed their invoices.

## Vulnerability Detail
``getInvoiceComplete()`` might return ``claimIds`` who have actually not completed their invoices because ``setInvoiceComplete()`` will push the ``_claimID`` to the list even when ``_invoiceComplete == false``.

As a result, ``getInvoiceComplete()`` will return a list ``claimIds`` including some that have not actually completed their invoices. 

```javascript
function getInvoiceComplete() external view returns (bytes memory) {
        return abi.encode(invoiceCompleteClaimIds);
    }
```

## Impact
``getInvoiceComplete()`` will return a list ``claimIds`` including some that have not actually completed their invoices.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Only push the ``_claimId`` only when ``_invoiceComplete == true``.
```diff
function setInvoiceComplete(bytes calldata _data) external onlyOpenQ {
        (bytes32 _claimId, bool _invoiceComplete) = abi.decode(
            _data,
            (bytes32, bool)
        );
        invoiceComplete[_claimId] = _invoiceComplete;
+     if(_invoiceComplete)
               invoiceCompleteClaimIds.push(_claimId);
    }
```
