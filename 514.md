# sinh3ck - Denial Of Service On `fundBountyToken()` Of Any Non-whitelisted Tokens

## Summary

Inconsistent behaviour leads to the possibility of preventing non-whitelisted tokens to be funded at all.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `depositManager.fundBountyToken()` has inconsistent behaviour and allows timing attacks to be introduced. As an example, on a bounty with a `openQTokenWhitelist` with `TOKEN_ADDRESS_LIMIT` of `1`:
- If a non-whitelisted token is funded first, further whitelisted tokens can still be funded.
- If a whitelisted token is funded first, further non-whitelisted tokens cannot be funded.

This inconsistency in behaviour allows Denial of Service attacks by frontrunning. A malicious actor may frontrun with `fundBountyToken()` transactions until the `TOKEN_ADDRESS_LIMIT` is reached. Added to the fact that it is possible to fund the bounty with `_tokenAddress == address(0) and `msg.value == 0` (since no check of zero-value is made when funding protocol tokens - see `BountyCore.receiveFunds()`), a malicious actor may deny service on all minted bounties at virtually no cost (except the cost of gas of making `fundBountyToken()` transactions).

As an example of the steps of an exploitation scenario:
1. Several bounties are minted by multiple users.
2. Malicious actor immediately funds the bounties by executing `fundBountyToken()` transactions with `_tokenAddress == address(0) and `msg.value == 0` until the `TOKEN_ADDRESS_LIMIT` is reached on all bounties.
3. No further funding of non-whitelisted tokens is possible on any bounty. It is still possible to fund with whitelisted tokens, but then the concept of non-whitelisted tokens doesn't make sense.

The following PoC can be included in [test/ClaimManager.test.js](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/test/ClaimManager.test.js):

```javascript
// ...

describe('fundBountyTokenExploit', () => {
	it('should revert if funded with a non-whitelisted token and bounty is at funded token address capacity', async () => {
		// ARRANGE
		await openQProxy.mintBounty(Constants.bountyId, Constants.organization, atomicBountyInitOperation);

		const bountyAddress = await openQProxy.bountyIdToAddress(Constants.bountyId);

		await blacklistedMockDai.approve(bountyAddress, 10000000);
		await mockLink.approve(bountyAddress, 10000000);

		// set lower capacity for token
		await openQTokenWhitelist.setTokenAddressLimit(1);

		// malicious actor frontruns with whitelisted token
		await depositManager.fundBountyToken(bountyAddress, ethers.constants.AddressZero, 1, 1, Constants.funderUuid);

		// non-whitelisted token funding is reverted
		// ACT + ASSERT
		await expect(depositManager.fundBountyToken(bountyAddress, blacklistedMockDai.address, 10000000, 1, Constants.funderUuid)).to.be.revertedWith('TOO_MANY_TOKEN_ADDRESSES');
	});
});

// ...
```

## Impact

Ultimately, a malicious actor may prevent funding of any non-whitelisted tokens on all bounties.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to make the behaviour consistent in terms of the return of the function `depositManager.fundBountyToken()` (and inherently `depositManager.tokenAddressLimitReached()`) when dealing with whitelisted and non-whitelisted tokens.
