# Refunds can be accidentally locked

## Summary
No expiration max may cause refunds to be locked for an excess amount of time

## Vulnerability Detail
As described in the documentation, the `expiration` is “The duration until the deposit becomes refundable”. Currently, the bounty expiration is unbounded on the upper end. This means that a depositor can accidentally set (e.g. fat finger, UI bug, resubmitting a transaction, etc.) an expiration to an extremely high amount. Another case of this issue is, if a user tries to call `extendDeposit()` multiple times because of internet issues. This is problematic because their deposit could be locked for an unexpectedly excess amount of time. 

## Impact
Since `BountyCore.getLockedFunds()` relies on the `expiration`, bounties can be bricked.

## Code Snippet

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Although this would be the fault of the depositor, there should be some additional safeguards against this by setting an max expiration.
