# "nonReentrant" modifier is present in the `refundDeposit` function but it doesn't actually prevent reentrancy attacks.

## Summary
The function `refundDeposit` does not have any protection against reentrancy attacks. This means that it's vulnerable to an attack, when it is repeatedly called, the `refundDeposit` function, causing an unintended repeated execution of the function.

## Vulnerability Detail
The main goal is to receive funds from a user (funder) in the form of either an ERC20 token or protocol token, store the deposit information, and allow for the refund of the deposit to the funder after a certain expiration time.

But it lacks measures to prevent reentrancy, and i notice the function can be called repeatedly while it is still executing,

## Impact
The vulnerability I see in the code is the lack of protection against reentrancy attacks. The "nonReentrant" modifier is present in the `refundDeposit` function but it doesn't actually prevent reentrancy attacks. The `refundDeposit` function could be called multiple times within a single call, allowing a call repeatedly can drain the contract's funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. I suggest introducing a `mutex` lock to prevent reentrant calls, it will prevent reentrancy attacks, by standard a mutex lock can be introduced in the code to make sure that a function is not executed multiple times simultaneously. This can be done using a `bool` flag that is set to `true` at the beginning of the function and set back to `false` at the end of the function.

2. Use the `transfer` function instead of `send` function, the transfer function can be used which will only transfer the funds and will not call any other function.

3. Then lastly add a `require` statement to check for sufficient balance before executing the `refundDeposit` function.

4. Please consider adding a delay of a few seconds, to be added after executing the `refundDeposit` function to ensure that the function is not called again within that time period.
