# [M-01] The malicious issuer of a bounty could update state of contracts. He then mislead users about information and prevent users from withdraw the prize.

## Summary

The malicious issuer of a bounty could update state of contracts. He then misleads users about information and prevents users from withdraw the prize.

## Vulnerability Details

Because the issuer could change the `payoutTokenAddress` variable, he could pretend that a ongoing bounty is solvent by switching the token address, actually it is not.

The `payoutTokenAddress` can be changed by calling `OpenQV1.setFundingGoal`, the issuer could call this function anytime to change the payoutTokenAddress and it affects other users who join the bounty.

Before or after the competition closes, the issuer could change payout schedule and update the volume and token pay by calling `OpenQV1.setPayoutScheduleFixed`, `OpenQV1.setPayoutSchedule` and `OpenQV1.setPayout`. User then receive different token with different amount.

Set `requireKYC` or `setInvoiceRequired` could be called at anytime by the issuer to update the condition, it can prevent the users from withdraw the prize.
