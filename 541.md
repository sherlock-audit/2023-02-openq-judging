# `setPayoutSchedule` will revert for tiered bounties in some condition



## Summary
`setPayoutSchedule` will revert for tiered bounties when the number of tiers decrease.

## Vulnerability Detail
The owner of a tiered bounty can set payout schedule using `setPayoutScheduleFixed` for a fixed tiered bounty, and `setPayoutSchedule` for a percentage tiered bounty through `OpenQV1`.
The implementations of those two functions have defects so they will revert when the owner wants to reduce the number of tiers. (TieredPercentageBountyV1.sol#L159-L167)

```solidity
159        string[] memory newTierWinners = new string[](payoutSchedule.length);

165        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tierWinners.length; i++) {
166            newTierWinners[i] = tierWinners[i];
167        }
```

The length of `newTierWinners` is same as the length of `payoutSchedule` and `tierWinners.length` is same as the number of old tiers. So if the number of new tiers are less than then number of old tiers, newTierWinners.length < tierWinners.length, and setPayoutSchedule will revert on Line 166 for i = newTierWinners.length.

But the comment above the code block says about the behaviour when resizing to fewer tiers so it should work without revert.

## Impact
The owner of tiered bounty can't resize to fewer tiers.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Loop until the minimum of `tierWinners.length` and `payoutSchedule.length`. And apply the same thing to `newInvoiceComplete` and `newSupportingDocumentsCompleted`, too.
