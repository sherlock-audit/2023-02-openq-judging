# BountyCore setKycRequired, setInvoiceRequired, setSupportingDocumentsRequired function can block users from claiming

## Summary
BountyCore setKycRequired, setInvoiceRequired, setSupportingDocumentsRequired function can block users from claiming
## Vulnerability Detail
Before claiming any bounty, ClaimManagerV1 checks if it's eligible to call.

```solidity
    function _eligibleToClaimAtomicBounty(IAtomicBounty bounty, address _closer)
        internal
        view
    {
        require(
            bounty.status() == OpenQDefinitions.OPEN,
            Errors.CONTRACT_IS_NOT_CLAIMABLE
        );


        if (bounty.invoiceRequired()) {
            bool _invoiceComplete = abi.decode(
                bounty.getInvoiceComplete(),
                (bool)
            );
            require(_invoiceComplete, Errors.INVOICE_NOT_COMPLETE);
        }


        if (bounty.supportingDocumentsRequired()) {
            bool _supportingDocumentsComplete = abi.decode(
                bounty.getSupportingDocumentsComplete(),
                (bool)
            );
            require(
                _supportingDocumentsComplete,
                Errors.SUPPORTING_DOCS_NOT_COMPLETE
            );
        }


        if (bounty.kycRequired()) {
            require(hasKYC(_closer), Errors.ADDRESS_LACKS_KYC);
        }
    }
```

As you can see function check if supportingDocumentsRequired, invoiceRequired, kycRequired adn check if the check is done.
Only if it's eligible, then it's possible to claim payment.

BountyCore has functions setKycRequired, setInvoiceRequired, setSupportingDocumentsRequired which allows owner set this params thorugh the OpenQV1 contract.

This allows ability for issuer to block claiming and then refund his funds and get the job done.
Example:
1.Issuer created bounty that doesn't require kyc.
2.Someone did the job and wants to claim.
3.Issuer frontruns claim call and set that kyc is required now.
4.User was not ok with kyc and he lost payment
5.Issuer refunded payment.
## Impact
Lose of payment for claimer.
