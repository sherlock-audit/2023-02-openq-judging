# Missing upper limit on `_expiration` can block user funds/NFT

## Summary
Several functions such as  `receiveNft()` , `receiveFunds()` , `fundBountyToken()` make use of `_expiration`, however none of the function sets an upper limit of  `_expiration` . If the value of  `_expiration` is very high then user funds/NFT can never be refunded/received
Since all users will be affected and no one will be able to retrieve the NFT or their funds if the value of `_expiration` is large, thus marking this as a `High` severity issue

## Vulnerability Detail

Following functions can take arbitrary large values for `_expiration`. Functions  `receiveNft()` , `receiveFunds()` , `fundBountyToken()` are missing a require check where an upper limit for `_expiration` should be implemented.

If the value of `_expiration` is very large then the following function will always fail and user can never retrieve their funds/receive NFT

```solidity
    function refundDeposit(
        bytes32 _depositId,
        address _funder,
        uint256 _volume
    ) external virtual onlyDepositManager nonReentrant {
        require(!refunded[_depositId], Errors.DEPOSIT_ALREADY_REFUNDED);
        require(funder[_depositId] == _funder, Errors.CALLER_NOT_FUNDER);
        require(
            block.timestamp >= depositTime[_depositId] + expiration[_depositId], //@audit this will always fail if the expiration time is very high.
            Errors.PREMATURE_REFUND_REQUEST
        );

        refunded[_depositId] = true;

        if (tokenAddress[_depositId] == address(0)) {
            _transferProtocolToken(funder[_depositId], _volume);
        } else if (isNFT[_depositId]) {
            _transferNft(
                tokenAddress[_depositId],
                funder[_depositId],
                tokenId[_depositId]
            );
        } else {
            _transferERC20(
                tokenAddress[_depositId],
                funder[_depositId],
                _volume
            );
        }
    }
```

The above code fails because of the [require check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L71-L74)

```solidity
 require(
            block.timestamp >= depositTime[_depositId] + expiration[_depositId], //@audit this will always fail if the expiration time is very high.
            Errors.PREMATURE_REFUND_REQUEST
        );

```

## Impact

value of  `_expiration` can be set to very large values such that the expiration time never comes. As a result the user funds/NFT can never be refunded/received. The following code will always fail if the value of  `_expiration` is very high
