# No guarentee of sufficient bounty when user tries to claim.

## Summary

Certain bounties are designed to guarentee a payout. Such as Ongoing bounty. However there is no guarentee that this amount will actually be avaible when it is time to claim. This will lead to a loss compensation for the claimant. 

## Vulnerability Detail

When a claimant tries to claim an Ongoing bounty the function will send whatever was set as `payOutVolume` to the claimant. If `payOutvolume` is greater than the balance avaible the transaction will fail. At this point the bounty issuer already has recieved the work from claimant and is not forced to fund the bounty. 

Here is a scenario:

Alice mints an `ongoingBounty` stating that each payout will be for 10 eth. 
Alice funds the bounty with 1 eth
Bob sees the great payout avaible and completes the bounty.
Alice accepts the submission and lets bob claim 
When bob attmepts to claim the 10 eth. The transaction reverts due to the bounty balance only beign 1 eth. 
Bob no has no access to the compenstion that he was owed and what was advertised. 

## Impact

Loss of compensation for claimant. 
Stealing of work by bounty issuer.
