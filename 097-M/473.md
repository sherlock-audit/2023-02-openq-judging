# Owner can change requirements anytime

## Summary

An issuer of the bounty can change the invoice, KYC, and document requirements anytime making it unfair from the participants' point of view.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the bounty is initialized, it assigns the initial values whether invoice, KYC, and supporting documents are required:
```solidity
    function initialize(
        string memory _bountyId,
        address _issuer,
        string memory _organization,
        address _openQ,
        address _claimManager,
        address _depositManager,
        OpenQDefinitions.InitOperation memory _operation
    ) external initializer {
        ...

        (
           ...
            bool _invoiceRequired,
            bool _kycRequired,
            bool _supportingDocumentsRequired,
           ...
        ) = abi.decode(
                _operation.data,
                (
                    bool,
                    address,
                    uint256,
                    bool,
                    bool,
                    bool,
                    string,
                    string,
                    string
                )
            );

        ...
        invoiceRequired = _invoiceRequired;
        kycRequired = _kycRequired;
        supportingDocumentsRequired = _supportingDocumentsRequired;
       ...
    }
```
However, the owner of the bounty can adjust these settings anytime:
```solidity
    /// @notice Whether or not KYC is required to fund and claim the bounty
    /// @param _kycRequired Whether or not KYC is required to fund and claim the bounty
    function setKycRequired(bool _kycRequired) external virtual onlyOpenQ {
        kycRequired = _kycRequired;
    }

    /// @notice Whether or not the Bounty is invoiceRequired
    /// @param _invoiceRequired Whether or not the Bounty is invoiceRequired
    function setInvoiceRequired(bool _invoiceRequired)
        external
        virtual
        onlyOpenQ
    {
        invoiceRequired = _invoiceRequired;
    }

    /// @notice Whether or not KYC is required to fund and claim the bounty
    /// @param _supportingDocumentsRequired Whether or not KYC is required to fund and claim the bounty
    function setSupportingDocumentsRequired(bool _supportingDocumentsRequired)
        external
        virtual
        onlyOpenQ
    {
        supportingDocumentsRequired = _supportingDocumentsRequired;
    }
```
The possibility to change the initial settings of the bounty gives an unfair advantage to the owner and reduces the trust of participants. For instance, the initial bounty might not require KYC, and users who do not want to disclose their personal data might jump and start working on it. However, when the claim time has come, an owner can ask for the KYC, and those who want to claim their rewards must do so. Or it could be the opposite. The initial version required KYC so many users decided to skip this bounty, but then this requirement was lifted up, leaving new participants with less time to compete with others.

## Impact

Users have no choice but to accept or decline the changes in settings. If users have already worked a lot to fulfill this bounty and then the settings change, they will have to either discard their work or faithfully accept the owner's demand.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I believe in immutability, so the initial parameters should not change. If owners want to introduce changes, they should create a new bounty. Or another mitigation is to apply the settings based on when the user joined the bounty if possible.
