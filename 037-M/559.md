# percentage tiered bounty issuer can game the payout schedule

## Summary
percentage tiered bounty issuer can bypass the `payout schedule == 100` check and rug users.

## Vulnerability Detail
`setPayoutSchedule` has a check to ensure the sum is 100%.
```solidity
contracts/Bounty/Implementations/TieredPercentageBountyV1.sol
153:         require(sum == 100, Errors.PAYOUT_SCHEDULE_MUST_ADD_TO_100);
```

The issuer can bypass this check if a lower tier claimant claims first:

imagine the following schedule: 1st gets 80%, 2nd gets 10%, 3rd gets 10%.
The second tier claims their token and get 10% of the pool.
The issuer then calls setPayoutSchedule, setting the tiers as follow: 1st gets 10%, 2nd gets 80%, 3rd gets 10%.
Because of [this check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/TieredPercentageBountyV1.sol#L113), the second tier claimant cannot claim anymore. This means after the 1st and 3rd will have claimed, only a total of 30% of the pool will have been claimed, and 70% of the pool will remain in the contract, which can be retrieved by the issuer with `refundDeposit`.

## Impact
An issuer can rug the claimants.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The first claim [closes the bounty](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/ClaimManager/Implementations/ClaimManagerV1.sol#L216). So adding a `require(status == OPEN)` check in `setPayoutSchedule` will prevent the issue.
