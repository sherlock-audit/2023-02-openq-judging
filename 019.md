# Attacker can fund bounty with malicious ERC20 and block payouts

## Summary
It is possible for any user to fund a bounty contract with any ERC20 token they want using the `DepositManagerV1.fundBountyToken` function.

When a payout is made for a `AtomicBountyV1` or `TieredPercentageBountyV1` contract, the `ClaimManagerV1` contract iterates over all deposited ERC20 tokens.

This behavior allows the attacker to craft a malicious ERC20 that reverts when the bounty contract tries to transfer it.

Thereby payouts are completely blocked.

And the funds are stuck until they can be refunded.

## Vulnerability Detail
The attacker can craft a malicious ERC20 token that allows for 1 transfer to work. This can be implemented via a counter that reverts when a second transfer is attempted.

Therefore the attacker can call `DepositManagerV1.fundBountyToken` and fund a bounty contract with this token.

When payouts are claimed, the malicious ERC20 will revert. The `ClaimManagerV1` contract loops over all ERC20 token so one token that reverts causes the payout functionality to be blocked. No other token can be paid out.

## Impact
The payout functionality of `AtomicBountyV1` and `TieredPercentageBountyV1` contracts can be blocked such that no payouts are possible.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It has been discussed with the sponsor that they want to allow users to fund bounty contracts with any token they want.

So the `ClaimManagerV1` contract should use try catch blocks such that a token transfer that reverts does not cause the payout to be blocked.
