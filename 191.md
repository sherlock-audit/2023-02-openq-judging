# The "DepositManagerOwnable" Contract Security Flaw has Uncontrolled Access to the "__DepositManagerOwnable_init" Method.

## Summary
The `depositManagerOwnable` Contract has a major security issue. The `__DepositManagerOwnable_init` function, which sets the deposit manager address, can be called by malicious actors despite being marked as internal and `onlyInitializing`. This can give them control over the contract. The function does not have proper access control, allowing the deposit `manager` address to be changed to any value, putting the contract at risk.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `DepositManagerOwnable` which is supposed to restrict access to certain methods to only the deposit manager address. This is achieved by storing the deposit manager address in a private state variable named `_depositManager` and checking it against the `_msgSender()` before executing the methods with the `onlyDepositManager` modifier.

However, there is an in this here. The function `__DepositManagerOwnable_init` is marked as internal and `onlyInitializing`, but it is still possible for malicious actors to call this function and change the deposit manager address. This would give them control over the contract and access to potentially sensitive methods.

For example, let's assume that `Alice` is the original deposit manager of the `OpenQ` contract which uses USDC as its currency. `Bob`, who is a malicious actor, discovers that he can call the `__DepositManagerOwnable_init` function and change the deposit manager address to his own. Now, Bob can perform actions as the deposit manager and potentially steal USDC from the contract.

Consider the following scenario: 
Bob is a malicious actor who wants to take advantage of a flaw in the `depositManagerOwnable` contract. This contract has a function called `__DepositManagerOwnable_init`, which is supposed to initialize the deposit manager address and should only be accessible during the contract's initialization phase. However, due to a lack of proper access control, Bob can still call this function and change the deposit manager address to his own, giving him complete control over the contract.

Here's how Bob could execute his plan:
1. Bob creates a new contract specifically designed to exploit this vulnerability.

2. He then calls the `__DepositManagerOwnable_init` function in the `depositManagerOwnable` contract and passes in his own address as the new deposit manager.

3. With this step, Bob has successfully taken control of the `depositManagerOwnable` contract and now has the power to modify it or access any sensitive information stored in it.
4. 
## Impact
`depositManagerOwnable` contract, which is marked as "internal" and "onlyInitializing", is a high-security flaw, as it allows unrestricted access to the `__DepositManagerOwnable_init` function. This function initializes the deposit manager address and is supposed to only be accessible during the contract's initialization phase. However, due to the absence of proper access control, malicious actors can still call this function and change the deposit manager address to an arbitrary value, giving them control over the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend four safeguards against this:

1. Remove the "onlyInitializing" modifier. This will prevent any external calls to the `__DepositManagerOwnable_init` function after contract deployment.

2. Replace "internal" visibility with "private" visibility. This will prevent the function from being called by any contract other than its own.

3. Add a constructor function to initialize the deposit manager address. The constructor function should be called only during contract deployment and should be marked as "external" to prevent it from being called later. The deposit manager address should be passed as an argument to the constructor.

5. Replace `__DepositManagerOwnable_init` with a new function `setDepositManager`. This function can be used to change the deposit manager address after contract deployment. This function should be marked as `onlyDepositManager` to restrict access to the deposit manager only.
