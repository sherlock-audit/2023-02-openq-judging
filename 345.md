# Anyone can initialize the Deposit Manager contract

## Summary
currently there are no restriction on who can initialize Deposit manager. However in the docs it states that only a proxy address can call this. In the read me it specifically says this:   `depositManager` (a proxy address)`. It states the same thing for claimmanager, however claimmanager has a modifier on it only allows a proxy to call it. This modifier is missing on depositManager. This is a deviation from the funcationality of the documentation. It also allows anyone to intialize the contract and become "owner" of it. 

## Vulnerability Detail
See summary 

## Impact
Deviation from intended functionality
Anyone can initialize and become owner of the contract.

## Recommendation
Add the only proxy modifier that the documentaions states it is suposed to have.
