# Lack of minimum _expiration duration check

## Summary
Funding of bounties lack of a check on minimum expiration time set. Any user can fund with `_expiration == 1` and be able to get a refund right away.

## Vulnerability Detail
The only check performed on _expiration is for it to be different from zero.
