# Double-entry point (Two Address) token might raise some issues

## Summary
Two address tokens exist in the blockchain, a token which has two addreses. For example, Synthetixâ€™s ProxyERC20 contract is such a token which exists in many forms (sUSD, sBTC, ... ). [TUSD, which famously caused a potential attack on Compound](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/compound-tusd-integration-issue-retrospective/) is another good example. Double-entry point (Two Address) token might raise some issues such as double spending and quicker reaching of `openQTokenWhitelist.TOKEN_ADDRESS_LIMIT()`.

## Vulnerability Detail
When `addToken()` is called by the owner in TokenWhitelist.sol, it only checks the token has not been whitelisted prior to whitelisting the token and incrementing `tokenCount`. There could be a scenario where the two addresses (of Double entry point token) are being registered successfully in two separate instances.

## Impact
This will speed up `TOKEN_ADDRESS_LIMIT` being reached by taking up double slots. Additionally, it could lead to double execution when `fundBountyToken()` is called by the proxy in DepositManagerV1.sol.

## Code Snippet
[File: TokenWhitelist.sol#L25-L32](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/TokenWhitelist/TokenWhitelist.sol#L25-L32)

```solidity
    function addToken(address _tokenAddress) external onlyOwner {
        require(
            !this.isWhitelisted(_tokenAddress),
            Errors.TOKEN_ALREADY_WHITELISTED
        );
        whitelist[_tokenAddress] = true;
        tokenCount++;
    }
```
[File: DepositManagerV1.sol#L36-L74](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L36-L74)

```solidity
    function fundBountyToken(
        address _bountyAddress,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _volume,
        uint256 _expiration,
        string memory funderUuid
    ) external payable onlyProxy {
        IBounty bounty = IBounty(payable(_bountyAddress));

        if (!isWhitelisted(_tokenAddress)) {
            require(
                !tokenAddressLimitReached(_bountyAddress),
                Errors.TOO_MANY_TOKEN_ADDRESSES
            );
        }

        require(bountyIsOpen(_bountyAddress), Errors.CONTRACT_ALREADY_CLOSED);

        (bytes32 depositId, uint256 volumeReceived) = bounty.receiveFunds{
            value: msg.value
        }(msg.sender, _tokenAddress, _volume, _expiration);

        bytes memory funderUuidBytes = abi.encode(funderUuid);

        emit TokenDepositReceived(
            depositId,
            _bountyAddress,
            bounty.bountyId(),
            bounty.organization(),
            _tokenAddress,
            block.timestamp,
            msg.sender,
            _expiration,
            volumeReceived,
            0,
            funderUuidBytes,
            VERSION_1
        );
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either redesign assets registration and limit any double entry point token if necessary by detecting a proxy pattern or balance checking when the asset is being transferred in order to prevent double spending (or transfer).
