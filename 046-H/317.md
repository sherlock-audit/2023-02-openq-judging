# User should not be able to get the refund before the developer claim the bounty and after the bounty is closed

## Summary

User should not be able to get the refund before the developer claim the bounty and after the bounty is closed

## Vulnerability Detail

Suppose user fund the contract 1000 USDC to atomic bounty contract, the developer wants to claim the bounty after completing the task, but the user changes his mind and get the refund of the 1000 USDC, the developer can claim no bounty at all.

Suppose user fund the contract 1000 USDC to tieredFixed contract bounty contract, the developer A wants to 500 USDC for tier1, then the user get the refund of the rest 500 USDC, the rest of developer cannot claim the bounty for tier2 and tier3.

Suppose user fund the contract 1000 USDC to the tierPercentage, when tierPercentageContract is closed, the code below executes:

```solidity
/// @notice Similar to close() for single priced bounties. closeCompetition() freezes the current funds for the competition.
function closeCompetition() external onlyClaimManager {
    require(
        status == OpenQDefinitions.OPEN,
        Errors.CONTRACT_ALREADY_CLOSED
    );

    status = OpenQDefinitions.CLOSED;
    bountyClosedTime = block.timestamp;

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < getTokenAddresses().length; i++) {
        address _tokenAddress = getTokenAddresses()[i];
        fundingTotals[_tokenAddress] = getTokenBalance(_tokenAddress);
    }
}
```

note the code fundingTotals[_tokenAddress] = getTokenBalance(_tokenAddress), the code takes the snapshot of the current token balance.

This is crucial because later when developer claim the bounty, the fundingTotals[_tokenAddresses] is used to calculate how much a user can claim.

```solidity
function claimTiered(
    address _payoutAddress,
    uint256 _tier,
    address _tokenAddress
) external onlyClaimManager nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
    require(
        bountyType == OpenQDefinitions.TIERED_PERCENTAGE,
        Errors.NOT_A_TIERED_BOUNTY
    );
    require(!tierClaimed[_tier], Errors.TIER_ALREADY_CLAIMED);

    uint256 claimedBalance = (payoutSchedule[_tier] *
        fundingTotals[_tokenAddress]) / 100;

    _transferToken(_tokenAddress, claimedBalance, _payoutAddress);
    return claimedBalance;
}
```

Note the code:

```solidity
uint256 claimedBalance = (payoutSchedule[_tier] *
  fundingTotals[_tokenAddress]) / 100;
```

Suppose user fund the contract 1000 USDC to the tierPercentage, and closeBounty is closed, the fundingTotals[_tokenAddress] for USDC is set 1000 USDC.

first user claims 40% of 1000 USDC token, which is 400 USDC, at this point, the user refund the deposit and get 600 USDC back, other user cannot claim from the bounty contract because the claimedBalance is calculated based on 1000 USDC fundingTotals[_tokenAddress] but the balance of the USDC changed after the bounty closed.

The comment suggests that the fund should be freezed after the close function is called but the deposit refund can violate the fund-freeze assumption.

```solidity
/// @notice Similar to close() for single priced bounties. closeCompetition() freezes the current funds for the competition.
```

## Impact

Developer cannot fully claim the bounty amount because the state is out of sync.

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol not let the user get the refund via DepositManager.sol and give the developer a time window the claim the bounty first after the bounty is closed.
