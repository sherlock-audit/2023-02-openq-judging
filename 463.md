# current `refundDeposit` design may cause a `claimBounty` experience bad for winner

## Summary

current `refundDeposit` design may cause a `claimBounty` experience bad for winner  

## Vulnerability Detail

Since OpenQ is a permission-less, anyone can fund a bounty. If someone `fundBounty` either with ERC20 or NFT token, then he can call `refundDeposit` if the `_expiration` is passed. 

This `expiration` is to lock the deposit for a certain time and currently the OpenQ doesn't have any `MINIMUM EXPIRATION` state variable, so as long as the `expiration > 0` it is accepted.

currently, the `refundDeposit` only check, if:
- it's already refunded
- if caller is not the funder
- if the expiration is passed

```solidity
File: BountyCore.sol
69:         require(!refunded[_depositId], Errors.DEPOSIT_ALREADY_REFUNDED);
70:         require(funder[_depositId] == _funder, Errors.CALLER_NOT_FUNDER);
71:         require(
72:             block.timestamp >= depositTime[_depositId] + expiration[_depositId],
73:             Errors.PREMATURE_REFUND_REQUEST
74:         );
```

When a Bounty is filled with a certain amount of reward for the winner, and it's fulfilled the required total reward needed, but turns out the `funder` did a `refundDeposit` when the Bounty status is closed (which no-one can fund the bounty again), then the claim / reward will be lack of reward token. The balance of reward token inside the contract will be less than they should have to cover all the winners rewards.

For example, in Tiered bounty type, this issue may lead to some winner (who are late to claim) doesn't get what they supposed to get, because of this `refundDeposit` (by some unknown person with small expiration time) decrease the balance of token.

We can't blame the issuer, since they didn't do anything wrong, because anyone can do this `irresponsible ` act, which fund a bounty token, and `refundDeposit` right after the Bounty is closed, which it's not good for protocol's experiences.

## Impact

`claimBounty` might failed for late claimer because of the token is being refunded to depositor.

86:         } else {

89:                 funder[_depositId],
90:                 _volume

92:         }
93:     }
```

## Recommendation

To prevent an early refund, make sure the `expiration` time is set to at least some minimum time, which can guarantee the deposit is not being withdrew before all winners claimed.
