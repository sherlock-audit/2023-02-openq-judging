# Multiple payments for one contributor but only one invoice required

## Summary

In OngoingBounty, a claimId is a hash encoding the contributor and the PR and this id is used as a key for whether supporting documents have been provided or an invoice has been completed. However, if a contributor makes several contributions and get paid multiple times, I guess we should verify that there is a new invoice for each payment. However, this is not checked in the contract since the mapping are all overridden since multiple payouts would generate the same claimId.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
function claimOngoingPayout(
        address _payoutAddress,
        bytes calldata _closerData
    ) external onlyClaimManager nonReentrant returns (address, uint256) {
        (, string memory claimant, , string memory claimantAsset) = abi.decode(
            _closerData,
            (address, string, address, string)
        );

        bytes32 _claimId = generateClaimId(claimant, claimantAsset);

        claimId[_claimId] = true; <================================================ same claim id for same user on same PR who makes 2 contributions or more and this makes overridden with the same value. Is it expected?
        claimIds.push(_claimId);

        _transferToken(payoutTokenAddress, payoutVolume, _payoutAddress);
        return (payoutTokenAddress, payoutVolume);
    }
```

## Impact

Only one invoice required to get the payment instead of as many invoices as there are payments for the same developers on the same PR.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Include the number of payments in the encoding function for generating a unique claim id for every claim from the same user and PR in order to verify whether there is an invoice for each payment.
