# `fundBountyToken()` txn will fail when user fund the bounty via ETH

## Summary
The funding can be done either in ETH or ERC20 token via `fundBountyToken()`. But the function will fail to transfer ETH to the bounty contract if sent `_volume` which is used for ERC20 transfer is zero.

## Vulnerability Detail
The user who provides funds in ETH with `_volume` as zero (which should be as only ETH is transferring), the txn will revert with error "ZERO_VOLUME_SENT".

Even though enough ETH has been sent from user, the breaking functionality of contract will not allow the transfers until the some non-zero `_volume` also sent or passed in params. 

**POC**
```javascript

it(`should fail if only ether transfers`, async () => {
	await openQProxy.mintBounty(Constants.bountyId, Constants.organization, atomicBountyInitOperation);
	const bountyAddress = await openQProxy.bountyIdToAddress(Constants.bountyId);

	const volume = 0;
	const msgvalue = ethers.utils.parseEther("1"); // 1 ether

	await expect(
		depositManager.fundBountyToken(bountyAddress, ethers.constants.AddressZero, volume, 1, Constants.funderUuid, { value: msgvalue })
	).to.be.revertedWith("ZERO_VOLUME_SENT");

})
```

## Impact
Unable to transfer ETH via `fundBountyToken`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In `BountyCore.sol`, for ETH transfers it should not check the _volume to be non-zero as _volume will only be used for ERC20 transfer.
