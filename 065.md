# BountyCore.receiveFunds doesn't return back native payment in case when it was provided along with another token

## Summary
BountyCore.receiveFunds doesn't return back native payment in case when it was provided along with another token.
## Vulnerability Detail
BountyCore.receiveFunds allows sender to fund contract. In case if `_tokenAddress == 0` that means that [payment is done in native token](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L42).

In case if not, then tokens [are sent to the contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L44).

In case if `_tokenAddress != 0` and user provided msg.value as well for any reason, then contract will not send back those funds and also will not revert.
As result user will lost funds.
## Impact
Sender loses funds.
