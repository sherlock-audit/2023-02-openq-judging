# in the AtomicBountyV1.sol: reciveNft there is wrong calculation of time

## Summary
in the AtomicBountyV1.sol there is a wrong calculation of reciveNft function time logic. 
## Vulnerability Detail

in the reciveNft function and in line 136 there is require that checks to make sure the _expiration is greater than 0 but it is not enough it actually also should check if the expiration is not past than timestamp.

## Impact
The impact of the vulnerability is that a bad actor could potentially exploit the incorrect time calculation in the receiveNft function to bypass the deposit expiration time, leading to unexpected or undesired behavior. 
also the BountyCore L35 affected
## Code Snippet
```solidity
function receiveNft(
        address _sender,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _tokenId,
        uint256 _expiration,
        bytes calldata
    ) external onlyDepositManager nonReentrant returns (bytes32) {
        require(
            nftDeposits.length < nftDepositLimit,
            Errors.NFT_DEPOSIT_LIMIT_REACHED
        );
        require(_expiration > 0, Errors.EXPIRATION_NOT_GREATER_THAN_ZERO);
        _receiveNft(_tokenAddress, _sender, _tokenId);

        bytes32 depositId = _generateDepositId();

        funder[depositId] = _sender;
        tokenAddress[depositId] = _tokenAddress;
        depositTime[depositId] = block.timestamp;
        tokenId[depositId] = _tokenId;
        expiration[depositId] = _expiration;
        isNFT[depositId] = true;

        deposits.push(depositId);
        nftDeposits.push(depositId);

        return depositId;
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
+ consider adding additional checks that pretends the _expiration to not being past than timestamp of when it created 
+ `require(_expiration > block.timestamp, Errors.EXPIRATION_IN_PAST);` probably sth like that
