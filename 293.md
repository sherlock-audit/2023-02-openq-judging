# ClaimManager can be 0 when a bounty is minted.

## Summary
When a bounty is created one of the state variables that are set is '_claimManager'. This varaibles purpose is to connect all claiming functionality to the bounty. This way when a user submits a PR that gets approved and merged they can claim thier bounty. However,  when a issuer mints a bounty `_claimManager`can be uninitaialized or `0`. If this were to happen this would lead to users being unable to claim thier bounty and essentially will have unintentionally provided thier services for free. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerabiltiy takes place when the project gets created. Bounties can be created when '_claimManager' is `0` which is possible becasue `bountyFacotry` gets set prior to `claimManager`. This means that anyone can create a bounty prior to `claimManager` being deployed and have thier bounty be unclaimable. This could be intentional in order to get free work. This could also be unintentional by an eager issuer ready to create a bounty. 

## Impact
Bounties issued during this window will be unclaimable and lead to users work getting taken for free

## Recommendation

Set claim manager before before setting bounty factory. Or require that claimmanager cannot be 0 when a bounty is issued.
