# Insufficient checks in `receiveFunds()` may freeze the user funds.

## Summary
Due to insufficient checks in `receiveFunds()`, it is possible for a user to send  `msg.value` with the `_tokenAddress`. So if a non zero ERC20 token address is being used (ie. not the protocol token) and along with the volume of token to transfer a `msg.value` is also sent, it may freeze the user funds.

Given that usersâ€™ funds would be locked, I consider this a high-risk issue.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L41-L45

```solidity
if (_tokenAddress == address(0)) {
            volumeReceived = msg.value;
        } else {
            volumeReceived = _receiveERC20(_tokenAddress, _funder, _volume);
        }
```

Note that there is a missing require check at `receiveFunds()` to check whether `msg.value == 0`

The `if` condition will fail in a situation where a non zero `_tokenAddress` is provided along with a `msg.value` and some token `_volume`. This will result in execution of the else condition, but because of the `msg.value` being sent, it will freeze the user funds (protocol token).

## Impact
The `if` condition will fail in a situation where a non zero `_tokenAddress` is provided along with a `msg.value` and some token `_volume`. This will result in execution of the else condition, but because of the `msg.value` being sent, it will freeze the user funds (protocol token).

## Code Snippet
```solidity
if (_tokenAddress == address(0)) {
            volumeReceived = msg.value;
        } else {
            volumeReceived = _receiveERC20(_tokenAddress, _funder, _volume);
        }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
A `require` statement should be used to check that  `msg.value == 0`
