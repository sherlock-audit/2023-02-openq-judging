# `closeCompetition()` does not freeze the current funds for the competition as expected

## Summary

`closeCompetition()` does not freeze the current funds for the competition as expected

## Vulnerability Detail

When `closeCompetition()` is called for tiered bounties, it is intended to freeze the current funds of the competition.

```solidity
    /// @notice Similar to close() for single priced bounties. closeCompetition() freezes the current funds for the competition.
    function closeCompetition() external onlyClaimManager {
        require(
            status == OpenQDefinitions.OPEN,
            Errors.CONTRACT_ALREADY_CLOSED
        );

        status = OpenQDefinitions.CLOSED;
        bountyClosedTime = block.timestamp;
    }
```

This is however ineffective becomes, because `ClaimManagerV1::claimBounty()` will still succeed because there is no check if the bounty is open.

## Impact

Claiming is still possible when funds are meant to be frozen.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement the check `bounty.status() == OpenQDefinitions.OPEN` in the `ClaimManagerV1::_eligibleToClaimTier` function
