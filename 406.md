# Tiered Fixed Bounty owners can cheat contributors out of a payout

## Summary

Owners of a TieredFixedBountyV1 can front-run calls to claimTierFixed with their own calls to setPayoutScheduleFixed, thereby cheating contributors out of a bounty.

(Note: I believe this attack is out of scope according to the contest instructions. I asked for clarification on Feb 9th and never got a response. I am writing these up hastily to put a stake in the ground. If it turns out that these are in-scope despite the rules suggesting otherwise, but this write-up is rejected because it was hastily written because the protocol owners never responded to my DM, I WILL cry foul.)

## Vulnerability Detail

See Summary. Note that setPayoutScheduleFixed can add new tiers and assign the entire payout to new, unwon tiers.

## Impact

Bounty owners can cheat contributors

## Code Snippet

There are no limitations on https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/TieredFixedBountyV1.sol#L138 or its caller. It can be called at any time, including after the contest closes.
