# lack of __gap variables in inherited contracts

## Summary
Some contracts inherited in BountyStorageCore.sol don't have a __gap variable in the OZ style to prevent from displacing storage layout when new variables are added:

## Vulnerability Detail
See the following inheritances:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Storage/BountyStorageCore.sol#L28-L30

Also since `BountyStorageCore` and `TieredBountyStorageCore` are inherited and can be receiving new state variables, these should be gapped as well.

The definitive list of contracts which should be gapped for future-safety:

- OnlyOpenQ
- ClaimManagerOwnable
- DepositManagerOwnable
- BountyStorageCore
- TieredBountyStorageCore

## Impact
If new variables are added to these contracts, storage layout may cause unpredictable state.

## Recommendation
Add __gap variables to be able to add new variables without changing storage layout
