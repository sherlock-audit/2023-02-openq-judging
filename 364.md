# a tier in the setPayoutSchedule can be 0

## Summary
when setting the payout schedule one of the tiers can be set to 0
## Vulnerability Detail
the payout schedule sets how much each participant gets when the bounty funds are released. which mean each person should receive more than 0. however payout schedule only checks that the percentages add up to 100. so tiers can be set to [100,0,0] and this would pass and be saved. 

## Impact
this means some participants wont get any rewards whatsoever. they will be expecting a payout that wont come
## Code Snippet

## Tool used

i altered the PoC in openQ.test.js under setPayoutSchedule. 

    it('should set payout schedule', async () => {
      // ARRANGE
   
      await openQProxy.mintBounty(
        Constants.bountyId,
        Constants.organization,
        tieredBountyInitOperation_permissionless

      )
const bountyAddress = await openQProxy.bountyIdToAddress(Constants.bountyId)
      const bounty = await TieredPercentageBountyV1.attach(bountyAddress)

      // ACT
      await openQProxy.setPayoutSchedule(Constants.bountyId, [100, 0, 0])

      // ASSERT
      const payoutSchedule = await bounty.getPayoutSchedule()
      const payoutToString = payoutSchedule.map((thing) =>
        parseInt(thing.toString())
      )
      expect(payoutToString[0]).to.equal(100)
      expect(payoutToString[1]).to.equal(0)
      expect(payoutToString[2]).to.equal(0)

})

## Recommendation
run a for loop on the array to make sure each index is at least greater than 0
