# If there are no checks off-chain while calling associateExternalIdToAddress , it might revert claiming bounty transactions.

## Summary

`associateExternalIdToAddress` is called by the oracle, but there are no-checks if the actual onwer of the `_associatedAddress` is forwarding this call to the oracle. If there are no such checks off chain too, then it might create an issue.

## Vulnerability Detail

Assume that a legit user has a mapping added for `externalUserIdToAddress` and `addressToExternalUserId`. Now, a malicious user tries to add the same address to their own userID.

> I am assuming that there is a functionality for a user to add an address where they would like to recieve the bounties after logging in to the website, so the github user ID is linked with the on-chain address.
> 

Initially the mapping would look like this:

```solidity
externalUserIdToAddress[legituserID] = legitUserAddress;
addressToExternalUserId[legitUserAddress] = legituserID;
```

The malicious user adds the same wallet which calls the function `associateExternalIdToAddress` with the following parameters:

`associateExternalIdToAddress(malicioususerID,legitUserAddress)` , the mapping would become:

```solidity
externalUserIdToAddress[legituserID] = address(0);
externalUserIdToAddress[malicioususerID] = legitUserAddress;
addressToExternalUserId[legitUserAddress] = malicioususerID;
```

Here the `legitUserAddress` is mapped with `malicioususerID`.

When the legit user now calls `permissionedClaimTieredBounty` , the function would check the value of the closer via 

```solidity
string memory closer = IOpenQ(openQ).addressToExternalUserId(
            msg.sender
        );
```

but this would just return the wrong closerId and the following check would fail, reverting the transaction:

```solidity
require(
            keccak256(abi.encode(closer)) ==
                keccak256(abi.encode(bounty.tierWinners(_tier))),
            Errors.CLAIMANT_NOT_TIER_WINNER
        );
```

## Impact

A legit claimant might be unable to claim bounty.

## Code Snippet

[`OpenQV1.sol:associateExternalIdToAddress`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/OpenQ/Implementations/OpenQV1.sol#L464)

```solidity
function associateExternalIdToAddress(
        string calldata _externalUserId,
        address _associatedAddress
    ) external onlyOracle {
        // Clear previous addres<=>off-chain identity associations
        string memory formerExternalUserId = addressToExternalUserId[
            _associatedAddress
        ];
        address formerAddress = externalUserIdToAddress[_externalUserId];

        externalUserIdToAddress[formerExternalUserId] = address(0);
        addressToExternalUserId[formerAddress] = '';

        externalUserIdToAddress[_externalUserId] = _associatedAddress;
        addressToExternalUserId[_associatedAddress] = _externalUserId;

        emit ExternalUserIdAssociatedWithAddress(
            _externalUserId,
            _associatedAddress,
            formerExternalUserId,
            formerAddress,
            new bytes(0),
            VERSION_1
        );
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

An ERC-2771 like message relayer can to get the correct address for `_associatedAddress`, or there should be sufficient checks off-chain before calling this function.
