# `solvent()` is implemented wrongly

## Summary
`solvent()` is can be used to check the solvency of a bounty. However, the current implementation is wrong and will return an incorrect or misleading result.

## Vulnerability Detail

`solvent()` can currently only be used on ongoing bounty despite what is documented as reported in one of my other issue. In ongoing bounty, `payoutVolume` is the amount that is paid to each contributor.

`solvent()` checks for `balance >= bounty.payoutVolume()`. We are checking if total balance of token in the contract is higher than a SINGLE payout. This means that the bounty is deemed solvent as long as contract is able to pay a single contributor. This is incorrect.

```solidity
function solvent(string calldata _bountyId) external view returns (bool) {
	IBounty bounty = getBounty(_bountyId);

	uint256 balance = bounty.getTokenBalance(bounty.payoutTokenAddress());
	return balance >= bounty.payoutVolume();
}
```

## Impact
Wrong implementation of `solvent()` results in a wrong return value in most cases.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We should check the balance with the total number of contributors * payoutVolume to get the correct check.
