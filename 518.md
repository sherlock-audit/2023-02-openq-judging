# Griefing attack can cause an indefinite DoS on the bounty minting functionality

## Summary
A malicious actor can front run any bounty minting transactions using the `_bountyId` value of these transactions. As a result, all `mintBounty` calls will revert due to the failed bounty ID uniqueness check. Users won't be able to mint any new bounty while the attack is in effect.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `mintBounty` function requires that the minter has specified a unique bounty ID. If the ID is already taken, the call will revert:
```solidity
function mintBounty(
    string calldata _bountyId,
    string calldata _organization,
    OpenQDefinitions.InitOperation memory _initOperation
) external nonReentrant onlyProxy returns (address) {
    require(
        bountyIdToAddress[_bountyId] == address(0),
        Errors.BOUNTY_ALREADY_EXISTS
    );
```

This allows a malicious actor to front run `mintBounty` calls and with the bounty IDs from these calls, causing reverts in the calls.
## Impact
The protocol becomes non-operational because users cannot use it's main featureâ€“minting and operating bounty contracts.

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Consider generating a unique bounty ID in the `mintBounty` function, instead of taking it from users. E.g., consider using a counter and new bounty's index as it's ID. In case a user-specified name is required by the needs of the protocol, consider allowing bounty minters to set a name after bounty contract creation.
