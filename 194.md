# Missing Input Validation in __OnlyOpenQ_init.

## Summary
The `__OnlyOpenQ_init` function does not perform any input validation on the `_initalOpenQ` parameter, which could lead to security vulnerabilities. For example, a malicious actor (Mallory) could pass an arbitrary address as the `_initalOpenQ` parameter and gain unauthorized access to methods restricted by the `onlyOpenQ` modifier.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function has a flaw in its `__OnlyOpenQ_init` function that could be taken advantage of by malicious individuals. As you can see this function is responsible for setting the `OpenQProxy` address in the contract, which is stored in a variable called `_openQ`. To protect sensitive information and prevent unauthorized manipulation, only the `OpenQProxy` is allowed to access certain methods within the contract.
```solidity
    function __OnlyOpenQ_init(address _initalOpenQ) internal {
        _openQ = _initalOpenQ;
    }
```
However, there is a problem with the `_initialOpenQ` parameter, which is used to initially set the `OpenQProxy` address in the contract. There is no validation for this input, allowing a malicious/bad actor to input any address they choose, which would then be stored as the `OpenQProxy` address in the contract.

This means that the malicious actor could then call methods within the contract that were previously restricted to only the `OpenQProxy`. This could result in dangerous consequences, such as gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information or manipulating the state of the contract for malicious purposes.

Vulnerability instance:
* Attacker (Mallory) can provide an arbitrary address as the `_initialOpenQ` parameter.

* This can result in the `_openQ` variable being set to an address that is controlled by Mallory, allowing them to bypass the `onlyOpenQ` modifier and execute restricted methods.

* Mallory could potentially steal or manipulate funds stored in the smart contract or its associated contracts.

## Impact
`__OnlyOpenQ_init` function is used to initialize the contract with the `OpenQProxy` address, which is later used in the `onlyOpenQ` modifier to restrict access to methods.

However, since the contract does not perform any input validation on the parameters passed to the `__OnlyOpenQ_init` function, an attacker could pass any arbitrary address as the `OpenQProxy` address. This would allow the attacker to bypass the restrictions set by the `onlyOpenQ` modifier and access methods that should only be callable by the `OpenQProxy` address.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I have 2 recommendations for this.

1. Add input validation: To prevent potential attacks, it is important to validate the input parameters passed to the __OnlyOpenQ_init function. One way to do this is to add a check to ensure that the input address is not the zero address (0x0).

2. Modify the `__OnlyOpenQ_init` function:
```solidity
function __OnlyOpenQ_init(address _initalOpenQ) internal {
    require(_initalOpenQ != address(0), "Invalid address input");
    _openQ = _initalOpenQ;
}
```
