# Payment schedule can be changed after a tier has already been claimed, which can prevent some claimants from being able to claim

## Summary
In tiered percentage bounty, bounty winners can claim a percentage of the bounty based on the tier they are in. 

Because payment schedule can be changed at any time with `setPayoutSchedule()`, some claimant's may be unable to claim due to insufficent funds remaining.

We note that there is a check to ensure payment schedule sums up to 100%, but changing payment schedule after claims has been made can break this invariant.

> require(sum == 100, Errors.PAYOUT_SCHEDULE_MUST_ADD_TO_100);

## Vulnerability Detail

We can use a simple example to illustrate this issue.

Imagine we have 3 tiers, divided in this way,

60% 30% 10%

The first tier winner claims 60% of the bounty.

Now, payment schedule is changed to

50% 30% 20%

Second tier winner claims 30% of the bounty.

There is only 10% bounty remaining, but the assigned bounty of third tier winner is 20%. This claimant will not be able to make his claim.

## Impact
Some claimants may be unable to make claims if payout schedule is changed.
