# Refund after close will cause lack of balance for TieredPercentageBounty



## Summary
Depositors can refund their funds after close of a bounty and it will cause lack of balance for TieredPercentageBounty. In this case claimers can't claim their payouts because the balance of bounty is not enough to transfer.


## Vulnerability Detail

For tiered percentage bounty, the claimers get payout from the scheduled percent of `fundingTotals`. (TieredPercentageBountyV1.sol#L115-L118)

```solidity
        uint256 claimedBalance = (payoutSchedule[_tier] *
            fundingTotals[_tokenAddress]) / 100;

        _transferToken(_tokenAddress, claimedBalance, _payoutAddress);
```
`fundingTotals` are locked in `closeCompetition`.(TieredPercentageBountyV1.sol#L123-L136)
```solidity
    function closeCompetition() external onlyClaimManager {
        ...
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < getTokenAddresses().length; i++) {
            address _tokenAddress = getTokenAddresses()[i];
            fundingTotals[_tokenAddress] = getTokenBalance(_tokenAddress);
        }
    }
```
But the `DepositManagerV1.refundDeposit` checks only expiration and doesn't check if current bounty is opened or closed. So depositors can refund their funds after close and the bounty's balance will be less than `fundingTotals` which is set when the bounty is closed.
As a result, claimers can't claim their payouts because the bounty doesn't have enough balance to transfer.

## Impact

Claimers can't claim their payouts because the bounty doesn't have enough balance to transfer.
