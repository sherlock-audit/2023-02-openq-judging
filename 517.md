# `issuer` can close ongoing bounty before all claims has been collected thus blocking the funds claiming process

## Summary

In the `OngoingBountyV1` contract the issuer can close the bounty before all the claims have been collected which will block the claiming process and users will not be able to claim their payouts.

## Vulnerability Detail

The bounty issuer can close the ongoing bounty at any time with the function `closeOngoing` in the `OpenQV1` contract, this function will internally call the `closeOngoing` function of the `OngoingBountyV1` contract which will close the bounty if it was in open status.

The issue here is that for claiming payouts for an ongoing bounty the function `claimBounty` in the ClaimManagerV1 contract must be called which will internally call the function `_claimOngoingBounty`, this function will check the eligibility of the claim with the help of `_eligibleToClaimOngoingBounty` which verify the bounty open status : 

```solidity
require(
    bounty.status() == OpenQDefinitions.OPEN,
    Errors.CONTRACT_IS_NOT_CLAIMABLE
);
```

So because the issuer can close the bounty at any time there is a scenario where the users will not be able to claims their payouts if issuer closes the bounty too soon as the `_eligibleToClaimOngoingBounty` will always revert if the bounty is closed.

## Impact

Users will not be able to claim bounty payouts if the issuer closes the ongoing bounty too soon.

## Code Snippet

The issue occurs because of the instances below : 

`closeOngoing` function callable at any time by the owner :

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To avoid this issue the ongoing bounty should have a waiting period before the issuer is allowed to close the bounty, thus all users are able to claim their payouts in this period
