# There will be double spending attack in "MintBounty" Function.

## Summary
The problem here lies in the `mintBounty` function, which can be called twice while the first call is still executing. This could lead to unintended consequences and even theft of funds. To keep things secure, it's important that the code is updated to include proper protection against these types of attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
   function mintBounty(
```
```solidity
     BeaconProxy bounty = new BeaconProxy(
            beaconProxy,
            abi.encodeWithSignature(
                'initialize(string,address,string,address,address,address,(uint32,bytes))',
                _id,
                _issuer,
                _organization,
                openQ(),
                _claimManager,
                _depositManager,
                _operation
            )
        );
```
In the code, the `OpenQ` `BountyFactory` contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack, an attacker can call the same function of the smart contract again while the first call is still executing. This can lead to unintended consequences, including the theft of funds or other malicious activities.

Let's consider a scenario where Mallory is the malicious actor and wants to exploit this vulnerability. Mallory could start by calling the `mintBounty` function and then call it again while the first call is still executing. This would allow Mallory to execute the same code multiple times in a row, which could result in unintended behavior and could allow Mallory to steal funds.

Here's an instance of how Mallory (The Malicious user) could possibly exploit this vulnerability:

* Mallory calls the `mintBounty` function with the appropriate parameters to initiate the creation of a new bounty.
    
* While the first call is still executing, Mallory calls the `mintBounty` function again with different parameters.

* Because the contract does not have any protection against reentrancy attacks, Mallory can keep calling the `mintBounty` function multiple times, leading to unintended behavior.

## Impact
The code does import the `BeaconProxy` contract from `@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/beacon/BeaconProxy.sol`. The `BeaconProxy` contract is an upgradeable contract that uses a proxy pattern to allow for upgrades to the implementation contract without affecting the contract's state or its address.

However, I can see while this implementation is a step towards making the contract upgradeable and less vulnerable to bugs and security issues, it still does not provide protection against reentrancy attacks. An attacker could still call the `mintBounty` function and then call it again while the first call is still executing, potentially causing unintended behavior and leading to a loss of funds and other harm.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Add a mutex lock to the `mintBounty` function. This will prevent another call to the function while the first call is still executing.

2. Modify the code to disallow sending ether to the contract during the execution of `mintBounty` function. This will prevent the attacker from executing an attack by calling the function repeatedly and sending Ether to the contract in each call.

3. Modify the code to require that the `mintBounty` function be called only from the `_openQ` contract. This will prevent an attacker from calling the function from another contract.
