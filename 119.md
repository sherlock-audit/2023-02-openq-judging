# Any bounty payment can be blocked by a malicious user funding with an nft

## Summary
In some types of bounties, a user can associate a tier when funding with an NFT. They can also decide to get a refund on their NFT, which means it is no longer held by the bounty. Unfortunately that can cause blocking of claiming for an arbitrary tier.

## Vulnerability Detail
when claiming tiered bounties, `nftDeposits` array is queried for deciding if a given tier should receive an nft.

if the nft has been refunded, the entry in the array is still here, but the nft transfer would fail.

## Impact
Any bounty payment can be blocked by a malicious user funding with an nft.
