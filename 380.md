# Storage gap missing for BountyStorageCore and TieredBountyStorageCore

## Summary
Storage gaps are missing for `BountyStorageCore` and `TieredBountyStorageCore` which may lead to corrupted storage in the upgradeable contracts that are derived from these two.

## Vulnerability Detail
`BountyStorageCore` and `TieredBountyStorageCore` define state variables. Same is true for the contracts that inherit from them:
- `AtomicBountyStorageV1`
- `OngoingBountyStorageV1`
- `TieredFixedBountyStorageV1`
- `TieredPercentageBountyStorageV1`

Adding storage to these two contracts will lead to corrupting derived ones. Therefore, it is advised to use storage gap pattern https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable#storage_gaps

Note, that there are other base contracts without gaps:
- `ClaimManagerOwnable`
- `DepositManagerOwnable`
- `OnlyOpenQ`
- `Oraclize`

These are unlikely to be changed and can be considered low severity unless developers see them being upgraded in the future.

## Impact
Base contract storage can't be extended without corrupting inherited contracts storage
