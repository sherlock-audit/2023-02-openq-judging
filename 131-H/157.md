# BountyCore.refundDeposit() might refund an amount that is more than the balance of the funder.

## Summary
BountyCore.refundDeposit() might refund an amount that is more than the balance of the funder.

## Vulnerability Detail
``BountyCore.refundDeposit()`` might refund an amount that is more than the balance of the funder since

1)  it never checks whether the amount to refund exceeds the balance of the funder or not. 
2) It does not debit the balance after the refund.

## Impact
Either the deposit manager might make a mistake and refund more than a funder deserve.

Or, if the deposit manager becomes malicious or compromised, he can drain the contract as follows: 

1) Call  ``receiveFunds()`` with minimal fee and very short expiration time for an attack account ``_funder`` address; 

2) Call ``refundDeposit()`` on the attack account ``_funder`` with a large amount for ``_volume``.

3) The deposit manager will receive the large amount of protocol tokens or ERC20 tokens in ``_funder``. 

4) Repeat above if necessary.

## Recommendation
1) Check and make sure that ``_volume`` never exceeds the balance; 
2) Debit the balance after the the refund.
