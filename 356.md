# Tiered bounties can be claimed even if they are `CLOSED`

## Summary

A bounty is supposed to be claimable only when its status is `OPEN`. However, the Tiered bounties are both set to closed on the first claim. They continue to be claimable even after this.

## Vulnerability Detail

Tiered bounties can be claimed even after their issuer sets them to closed.

The `bountyIsClaimable` function is incorrect by extension.

## Impact

Deposited funds can be lost to claimants even if the bounty is closed.

## Recommendation

Change the operation of Tiered bounties such that they do not allow claiming while `CLOSED`.
