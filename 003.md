# Centralization risk: OpenQV1.sol have a single point of control for the function transferOracle

## Summary

Centralization risks are weaknesses that malevolent project creators as well as hostile outside attackers can take advantage of. They may be used in several forms of attacks, including rug pulls and infinite minting vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Detail

When contracts have a single point of control, contract owners need to be trusted to prevent fraudulent upgrades and money draining since they have privileged access to carry out administrative chores.
