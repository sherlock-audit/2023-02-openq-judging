# Attacker can block NFT deposits for the bounty by filling up the limit

## Summary
Bounties have a limit of 5 NFT rewards. Attacker can exploit that and prevent bounty owner from depositing NFTs.

## Vulnerability Detail
Bounties can be funded with up to 5 NFTs. Funding is permissionless, meaning anyone can send tokens to the bounty contract. Furthermore, refunding an NFT deposit does give the slot back as it doesn't remove the item from `nftDeposits` collection. This can be exploited in a number of ways. For example, if bounty owner wants to deposit multiple NFTs to the bounty contract, attacker can do the following:
- Wait until bounty owner deposits the first NFT
- Deposit 4 NFTs with minimal expiration
- Refund 4 NFT deposits

Bounty owner will not be able to deposit any of the remaining NFTs. As a result, the bounty contract will be rendered useless and the NFT that was deposited first will be locked until expiration.

## Impact
Attacker can render deployed bounty contract useless

## Recommendation

Consider denying external users to fund bounties. Alternatively, allow bounty owner to deposit NFTs in batch so that the issue described above cannot hurt the depositor
