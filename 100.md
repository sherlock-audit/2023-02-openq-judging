# OpenQV1 doesn't initialize Oraclize contract

## Summary
OpenQV1 doesn't initialize Oraclize contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
OpenQV1 contract extends Oraclize contract which [needs to be initialized](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/Oracle/Oraclize.sol#L20-L22) with oracle.
But initialize function of OpenQV1 [doesn't provide oracle](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/OpenQ/Implementations/OpenQV1.sol#L14-L18) to Oraclize.

Because of that `OpenQV1.associateExternalIdToAddress` will fail, when it will be called by oracle in order to assign id of user to his address. And as result of that, users will not be able to call `ClaimManagerV1.permissionedClaimTieredBounty` in order to claim bounty by themselves, as [this check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq/blob/main/contracts/ClaimManager/Implementations/ClaimManagerV1.sol#L90-L94) will not pass.

Of course, after it will be noticed it's possible to provide oracle, but it will take some time do understand the problem and provides poor user experience for those who can't claim rewards.
## Impact
Oracle can't call `OpenQV1.associateExternalIdToAddress`, users can't claim rewards by themselves.

## Recommendation
When initialize OpenQV1, also initialize Oraclize with oracle address.
