# Rebasing tokens will not be fully refunded in case of increased supply

## Summary
Rebasing tokens will not be fully refunded in case of increased supply

## Vulnerability Detail
When refunding an ERC20 deposit, the amount is capped at deposit volume

If rebasing token was used and its supply increased, the refund will not be in full.

## Impact
Deposit refund may not be in full for rebasing tokens
